The method consists\nof a modified Monte Carlo integration over configuration space. Results\nfor the two-dimensional rigid-sphere system have been obtained on\nthe Los Alamos MANIAC and are presented here. These results are compared\nto the free volume equation of state and to a four-term virial coefficient\nexpansion.
