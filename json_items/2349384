For those based on random walk candidate distributions, we find sufficient conditions for moments and for moment generating functions to converge at a geometric rate to a prescribed distribution . By phrasing the conditions in terms of the curvature of the densities we show that the results apply to all distributions with positive density of the form (x) = h(x) exp(p(x)) where h and p are polynomials on IR d and p has an appropriate \"negativedefiniteness \" property. From these results we further develop central limit theorems for the Metropolis algorithm. Converse results, showing non-geometric convergence rates for chains where the rejection rate is not bounded from unity, are also given; these show that the negative-definiteness property is not redundant.
