The first stage consists of solving an approximated RBDO problem using meta-models. In order to use gradient-based techniques, the sensitivity of failure probabilities are derived with respect to hyper-parameters of random variables as well as, and this is a novelty, deterministic variables. The second stage focuses on the local refinement of the meta-models around the first stage solution using generalized \" max-min \" samples. The approach is demonstrated on three examples including a crashworthiness problem with 11 random variables and 10 probabilistic constraints.", "authors": ["Sylvain Lacaze", "Samy Missoum", "Lo√Øc Brevault", "Mathieu Balesdent"], "citations": [], "id": 280105735}
