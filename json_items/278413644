At each MCMC sampling step, the algorithm randomly\ndraws a mini-batch of data samples to estimate the gradient of log-posterior\nand further estimates the intractable expectation over latent variables via a\nGibbs sampler or a neural adaptive importance sampler. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness on learning deep sigmoid belief networks (DSBNs). Compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods using Gibbs sampling with data augmentation, our\nalgorithm is much more efficient and manages to learn DSBNs on large datasets.", "authors": ["Chao Du", "Jun Zhu", "Bo Zhang"], "citations": [], "id": 278413644}
