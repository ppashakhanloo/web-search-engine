There exists various kinds of human laugh signal, for example:\nvocalized laugh and non vocalized laugh. Following the theories of psychology,\namong all the vocalized laugh type, rhythmic staccato-vocalization\nsignificantly evokes the positive responses in the interactions. In this paper\nwe attempt to exploit this observation to detect human laugh occurrences, i.e.,\nthe laughter, in multiparty conversations from the AMI meeting corpus. First,\nwe separate the high energy frames from speech, leaving out the low energy\nframes through power spectral density estimation. We borrow the algorithm of\nrhythm detection from the area of music analysis to use that on the high energy\nframes. Finally, we detect rhythmic laugh frames, analyzing the candidate\nrhythmic frames using statistics. This novel approach for detection of\n`positive' rhythmic human laughter performs better than the standard laughter\nclassification baseline.", "authors": ["Sucheta Ghosh", "Milos Cernak", "Sarbani Palit", "B.
