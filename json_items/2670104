They have therefore not\nbeen available for application to Bayesian model determination, where the dimensionality of the parameter vector is typically\nnot fixed. This paper proposes a new framework for the construction of reversible Markov chain samplers that jump between\nparameter subspaces of differing dimensionality, which is flexible and entirely constructive. It should therefore have wide\napplicability in model determination problems. The methodology is illustrated with applications to multiple change-point analysis\nin one and two dimensions, and to a Bayesian comparison of binomial experiments.", "authors": ["Peter J.
