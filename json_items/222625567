This problem is NP-complete, so we look for tractable subcases of the problem by placing constraints on the network architecture. The focus of these constraints is on various families of “shallow” architectures which are defined to have bounded depth and un-bounded width. We introduce a perspective on shallow networks, called the Support Cone Interaction (SCI) graph, which is helpful in distinguishing tractable from intractable subcases: When the SCI graph is a tree or is of limited bandwidth, loading can be accomplished in polynomial time; when its bandwidth is not limited we find the problem NP-complete even if the SCI graph is a simple 2-dimensional planar grid.", "authors": ["Stephen Judd"], "citations": [236736803, 221618614, 11042143, 3775774, 2617300, 14928990, 3533271, 220343948, 36003332, 242393436], "id": 222625567}
