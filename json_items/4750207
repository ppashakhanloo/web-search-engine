The design criterion considered is the expected Shannon information gain of the posterior distribution obtained from performing a given experiment compared with the prior distribution. Genetic algorithms are described and then applied to experimental designs. The methodology is then illustrated with a wide range of examples: linear and nonlinear regression, single and multiple factors, and normal and Bernoulli distributed experimental data.", "authors": ["Hamada M", "H.
