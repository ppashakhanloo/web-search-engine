In this paper, a methodology for the identification and short-term prediction of the traffic state is presented. The methodology combines model-based clustering, variable-length Markov chains and nearest neighbor classification. An application of the methodology for short-term speed prediction in a freeway network in Irvine, CA, shows encouraging results.", "authors": ["Constantinos Antoniou", "Haris N Koutsopoulos", "George Yannis"], "citations": [267847206, 47784780], "id": 236670503}
