Although this framework is fully general, we illustrate our approach with a particular specialisation that we denote the `relevance vector machine' (RVM), a model of identical functional form to the popular and state-of-the-art `support vector machine' (SVM). We demonstrate that by exploiting a probabilistic Bayesian learning framework, we can derive accurate prediction models which typically utilise dramatically fewer basis functions than a comparable SVM while oering a number of additional advantages. These include the benets of probabilistic predictions, automatic estimation of `nuisance' parameters, and the facility to utilise arbitrary basis functions (e.g. non-`Mercer' kernels).", "authors": ["Alex Smola"], "citations": [253300771, 254700729, 228337292, 229065945, 255564628, 228360475, 224250185, 224225434, 220343759, 48210378], "id": 2413122}
