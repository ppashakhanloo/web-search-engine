The well-known adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm of (Haario\netal. 2001) is extended herein to scale asymptotically uniformly with respect\nto the underlying parameter dimension for Gaussian targets, by respecting the\nvariance of the target. The resulting algorithm, referred to as the\ndimension-independent adaptive Metropolis (DIAM) algorithm, also shows improved\nperformance with respect to adaptive Metropolis on non-Gaussian targets. This\nalgorithm is further improved, and the possibility of probing high-dimensional\ntargets is enabled, via GPU-accelerated numerical libraries and periodically\nsynchronized concurrent chains (justified a posteriori). Asymptotically in\ndimension, this GPU implementation exhibits a factor of four improvement versus\na competitive CPU-based Intel MKL parallel version alone. Strong scaling to\nconcurrent chains is exhibited, through a combination of longer time per sample\nbatch (weak scaling) and yet fewer necessary samples to convergence. The\nalgorithm performance is illustrated on several Gaussian and non-Gaussian\ntarget examples, in which the dimension may be in excess of one thousand.", "authors": ["Yuxin Chen", "David Keyes", "Kody J.
