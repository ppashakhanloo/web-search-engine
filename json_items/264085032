User annotations are often noisy, so methods to\ncombine the annotations to produce reliable estimates of the ground truth are\nnecessary. We claim that considering the existence of clusters of users in this\ncombination step can improve the performance. This is especially important in\nearly stages of crowdsourcing implementations, where the number of annotations\nis low. At this stage there is not enough information to accurately estimate\nthe bias introduced by each annotator separately, so we have to resort to\nmodels that consider the statistical links among them. In addition, finding\nthese clusters is interesting in itself as knowing the behavior of the pool of\nannotators allows implementing efficient active learning strategies. Based on\nthis, we propose in this paper two new fully unsupervised models based on a\nChinese Restaurant Process (CRP) prior and a hierarchical structure that allows\ninferring these groups jointly with the ground truth and the properties of the\nusers. Efficient inference algorithms based on Gibbs sampling with auxiliary\nvariables are proposed. Finally, we perform experiments, both on synthetic and\nreal databases, to show the advantages of our models over state-of-the-art\nalgorithms.", "authors": ["Pablo G.
