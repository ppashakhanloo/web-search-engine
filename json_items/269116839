For\ntractable inference approximations to the marginal likelihood of the model must\nbe made. The original approach to approximate inference in these models used\nvariational compression to allow for approximate variational marginalization of\nthe hidden variables leading to a lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the\nmodel [Damianou and Lawrence, 2013]. In this paper we extend this idea with a\nnested variational compression. The resulting lower bound on the likelihood can\nbe easily parallelized or adapted for stochastic variational inference.", "authors": ["James Hensman", "Neil D.
