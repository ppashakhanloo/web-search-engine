The parallelization scheme\narises naturally from the modular computational structure w.r.t. datapoints in\nthe sparse Gaussian process formulation. Additionally, the computational\nbottleneck is implemented with GPU acceleration for further speed up. Combining\nboth techniques allows applying Gaussian process models to millions of\ndatapoints. The efficiency of our algorithm is demonstrated with a synthetic\ndataset. Its source code has been integrated into our popular software library\nGPy.", "authors": ["Zhenwen Dai", "Andreas Damianou", "James Hensman", "Neil Lawrence"], "citations": [281486855, 283296484, 268079368, 284476380], "id": 267157313}
