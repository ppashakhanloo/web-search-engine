The target dynamics are described by a non-parametric mixture model that can learn a potentially infinite number of motion patterns. Assuming that each motion pattern can be represented as a velocity field, the target behaviors can be described by a non-parametric Dirichlet process-Gaussian process (DP-GP) mixture model. The DP-GP model has been successfully applied for clustering time-invariant spatial phenomena due to its flexibility to adapt to data complexity without overfitting. A new DP-GP information value function is presented that can be used by the sensor to explore and improve the DP-GP mixture model. The optimal camera control is computed to maximize this information value function online via a computationally efficient particle-based search method. The proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations and hardware experiments in the RAVEN testbed at MIT.", "authors": ["Hongchuan Wei", "Wenjie Lu", "Silvia Ferrari", "Robert H.
