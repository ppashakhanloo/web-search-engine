In this model, recognition is a process of annotating image\nregions with words. Firstly, images are segmented into regions, which are classified into region types using a variety of\nfeatures. A mapping between region types and keywords supplied with the images, is then learned, using a method based around\nEM. This process is analogous with learning a lexicon from an aligned bitext. For the implementation we describe, these words\nare nouns taken from a large vocabulary. On a large test set, the method can predict numerous words with high accuracy. Simple\nmethods identify words that cannot be predicted well. We show how to cluster words that individually are difficult to predict\ninto clusters that can be predicted well â€” for example, we cannot predict the distinction between train and locomotive using\nthe current set of features, but we can predict the underlying concept. The method is trained on a substantial collection\nof images. Extensive experimental results illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of the approach.", "authors": ["P. Duygulu", "K. Barnard", "J. F.
