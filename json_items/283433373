In the proposed\nframework, processing nodes receive a sequence of data minibatches, compute a\nvariational posterior for each, and make asynchronous streaming updates to a\ncentral model. In contrast to previous algorithms, the proposed framework is\ntruly streaming, distributed, asynchronous, learning-rate-free, and\ntruncation-free. The key challenge in developing the framework, arising from\nthe fact that BNP models do not impose an inherent ordering on their\ncomponents, is finding the correspondence between minibatch and central BNP\nposterior components before performing each update. To address this, the paper\ndevelops a combinatorial optimization problem over component correspondences,\nand provides an efficient solution technique. The paper concludes with an\napplication of the methodology to the DP mixture model, with experimental\nresults demonstrating its practical scalability and performance.", "authors": ["Trevor Campbell", "Julian Straub", "John W.
