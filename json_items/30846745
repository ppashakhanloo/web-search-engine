The subject populations were art history specialists and non-specialists. Through focus group interviews, a controlled test, post-test interviews and an online survey, data was gathered to compare preferences and actual patterns of use in browsing and searching. While specialists preferred direct search to browsing, and generalists used browsing as their preferred mode, both user groups found each mode to play a role depending on information need, and found value in a system combining both browse and direct search. There were no significant differences in performance among the search modes of browse, search, and combined browse/search models when the quasi-controlled study tested the different modes.
