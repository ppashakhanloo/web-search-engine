{"references": [], "title": "Sandwiching the marginal likelihood using bidirectional Monte Carlo", "abstract": "  Computing the marginal likelihood (ML) of a model requires marginalizing out\nall of the parameters and latent variables, a difficult high-dimensional\nsummation or integration problem. To make matters worse, it is often hard to\nmeasure the accuracy of one's ML estimates. We present bidirectional Monte\nCarlo, a technique for obtaining accurate log-ML estimates on data simulated\nfrom a model. This method obtains stochastic lower bounds on the log-ML using\nannealed importance sampling or sequential Monte Carlo, and obtains stochastic\nupper bounds by running these same algorithms in reverse starting from an exact\nposterior sample. The true value can be sandwiched between these two stochastic\nbounds with high probability. Using the ground truth log-ML estimates obtained\nfrom our method, we quantitatively evaluate a wide variety of existing ML\nestimators on several latent variable models: clustering, a low rank\napproximation, and a binary attributes model. These experiments yield insights\ninto how to accurately estimate marginal likelihoods. ", "authors": ["Roger B. Grosse", "Ryan P. Adams", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "citations": [], "id": 283658712}
