Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.", "authors": ["Danilo Jimenez Rezende", "Shakir Mohamed", "Daan Wierstra"], "citations": [284579582, 284476621, 284219020, 284218872, 284476463, 284476380, 284218982, 284219537, 283532090, 283433446], "id": 262991675}
