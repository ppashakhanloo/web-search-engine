We first use multivariate Gaussian distributions to model continuous quantity in PLSA, avoiding information loss between feature-instance versus real-world matching. Multi-modal correlations are learned in an asymmetrical manner, giving a better control of the respective influence of each modality in the latent space. Then we propose a new propagation pattern to refine multi-modal correlations by efficiently taking the complementary from multi-modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is accurate and robust for cross-media information retrieval.", "authors": ["Wanxia Lin", "Tong Lu", "Feng Su"], "citations": [271740418, 286076830], "id": 220988784}
