Two distinct\ninterpretations are possible, one connected with the number of clusters in the sample and\none with the number in the population. Under suitable conditions, these questions may have\nessentially the same answer, but it is logically possible for one answer to be finite and\nthe other infinite. This paper reformulates the standard Dirichlet allocation model as a\ncluster process in such a way that these and related questions can be addressed directly.\nOur conclusion is that the data are sometimes informative for clustering points in the\nsample, but they seldom contain much information about parameters such as the number of\nclusters in the population.", "authors": ["Peter McCullagh", "Jie Yang"], "citations": [220927901, 252162005, 227464440, 220895959, 241525054, 222912428, 51916305, 251532388, 236628976, 257805215], "id": 242306947}
