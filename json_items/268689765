We show a\ncorrespondence with the de Finetti approach of constructing an exchangeable\nsurvival process by generating iid survival times conditional on a completely\nindependent hazard measure. We describe several specific processes, showing how\nthe number of blocks of tied failure times grows asymptotically with the number\nof individuals in each case. We end by applying these methods to data, showing\nhow they can be easily extended to handle censoring and inhomogeneity among\npatients.", "authors": ["Walter Dempsey", "Peter McCullagh"], "citations": [269116563], "id": 268689765}
