The performance of MDRNN is\nimproved by further increasing its depth, and the difficulty of learning the\ndeeper network is overcome by Hessian-free (HF) optimization. Considering that\nconnectionist temporal classification (CTC) is utilized as an objective of\nlearning MDRNN for sequence labelling, the non-convexity of CTC poses a problem\nto apply HF to the network. As a solution to this, a convex approximation of\nCTC is formulated and its relationship with the EM algorithm and the Fisher\ninformation matrix is discussed. MDRNN up to the depth of 15 layers is\nsuccessfully trained using HF, resulting in improved performance for sequence\nlabelling.", "authors": ["Minhyung Cho", "Chandra Shekhar Dhir", "Jaehyung Lee"], "citations": [], "id": 281768642}
