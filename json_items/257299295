Using probit regression as a working example, this paper\npresents a simple methodology based on Markov chain Monte Carlo and the\npseudo-marginal approach that efficiently addresses both those questions. The\nresults presented in this paper show improvements over previous approaches for\nsampling from the posterior distribution of the parameters of the covariance\nfunction of the Gaussian Process prior. This is particularly important as it\noffers a powerful tool to carry out the fully Bayesian treatment of Gaussian\nProcess based statistical models. The results also demonstrate that Monte Carlo\nbased integration of all model parameters is actually feasible providing a\nsuperior quantification of uncertainty in predictions. Comparison with respect\nto state-of-the-art probabilistic classifiers confirm this assertion. Finally,\nthis paper demonstrates with an application on a financial time series that the\nproposed methodology can exploit sparsity in the inverse covariance of the\nGaussian Process prior leading to a computationally efficient Markov chain\nMonte Carlo approach.", "authors": ["Maurizio Filippone", "Mark Girolami"], "citations": [259010234, 261198282], "id": 257299295}
