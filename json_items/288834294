Using predetermined tolerances of the manufacturing process, the reliability analysis provides a failure probability of the considered antenna according to imposed specifications. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted in order to quantify the relative weight of the antenna’s parameters on the variability of |S11|. On this basis, a reliability-aware definition of optimization parameters can be derived to minimize failure probability during fabrication. For demonstration, a particular type of antenna, namely the tapered half-mode substrate-integrated waveguide (HMSIW) leaky-wave antenna, is chosen for the reliability analysis and optimization. This antenna is optimized for operation in the band from 7 GHz to 14 GHz (with specification |S11| < 􀀀10 dB) with a calculated failure probability of less than 1%. A fabrication of the designed prototype yields measurements showing a strict adherence to specifications, which exemplifies the relevance of the statistical analysis. The study can be generalized to any wideband antenna provided that a fast computation of cost function can be obtained.", "authors": ["Attibaud Kouassi", "Nghia Nguyen-Trong", "Thomas Kaufmann", "Sébastien Lalléchère", "Pierre Bonnet", "Christophe Fumeaux"], "citations": [], "id": 288834294}
