The ultimate challenge being to unveil\nbrain's connectivity, here we focus on a microscopic vision of the problem,\nwhere single neurons (potentially connected to a network of peers) are at the\ncore of our study. The sole observation available are noisy, sampled voltage\ntraces obtained from intracellular recordings. We design algorithms and\ninference methods using the tools provided by stochastic filtering, that allow\na probabilistic interpretation and treatment of the problem. Using particle\nfiltering we are able to reconstruct traces of voltages and estimate the time\ncourse of auxiliary variables. By extending the algorithm, through PMCMC\nmethodology, we are able to estimate hidden physiological parameters as well,\nlike intrinsic conductances or reversal potentials. Last, but not least, the\nmethod is applied to estimate synaptic conductances arriving at a target cell,\nthus reconstructing the synaptic excitatory/inhibitory input traces. Notably,\nthese estimations have a bound-achieving performance even in spiking regimes.", "authors": ["Pau Closas", "Antoni Guillamon"], "citations": [], "id": 283761407}
