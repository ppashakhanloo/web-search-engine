Comput. 36:45–54, 2007). This new sampler allows for the fitting of infinite mixture models with a wide-range of prior specifications. To illustrate\nthis flexibility we consider priors defined through infinite sequences of independent positive random variables. Two applications\nare considered: density estimation using mixture models and hazard function estimation. In each case we show how the slice\nefficient sampler can be applied to make inference in the models. In the mixture case, two submodels are studied in detail.\nThe first one assumes that the positive random variables are Gamma distributed and the second assumes that they are inverse-Gaussian\ndistributed. Both priors have two hyperparameters and we consider their effect on the prior distribution of the number of\noccupied clusters in a sample. Extensive computational comparisons with alternative “conditional” simulation techniques for\nmixture models using the standard Dirichlet process prior and our new priors are made. The properties of the new priors are\nillustrated on a density estimation problem.", "authors": ["Maria Kalli", "Jim E. Griffin", "Stephen G.
