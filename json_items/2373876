We propose a novel technique for estimating such models using the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data. 1", "authors": ["Victor Lavrenko", "W.
