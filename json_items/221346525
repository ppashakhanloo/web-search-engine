In many applications, one is interested in multiple signals that may be measured in multiple CS-type measurements, where here each signal corresponds to a sensing \"task\". In this paper we propose a novel multitask compressive sensing framework based on a Bayesian formalism, where a Dirichlet process (DP) prior is employed, yielding a principled means of simultaneously inferring the appropriate sharing mechanisms as well as CS inversion for each task. A variational Bayesian (VB) inference algorithm is employed to estimate the full posterior on the model parameters.", "authors": ["Yuting Qi", "Dehong Liu", "David B.
