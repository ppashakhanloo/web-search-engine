Here, we show that privileged information can naturally be treated\nas noise in the latent function of a Gaussian Process classifier (GPC). That\nis, in contrast to the standard GPC setting, the latent function is not just a\nnuisance but a feature: it becomes a natural measure of confidence about the\ntraining data by modulating the slope of the GPC sigmoid likelihood function.\nExtensive experiments on public datasets show that the proposed GPC method\nusing privileged noise, called GPC+, improves over a standard GPC without\nprivileged knowledge, and also over the current state-of-the-art SVM-based\nmethod, SVM+. Moreover, we show that advanced neural networks and deep learning\nmethods can be compressed as privileged information.", "authors": ["Daniel Hern√°ndez-Lobato", "Viktoriia Sharmanska", "Kristian Kersting", "Christoph H.
