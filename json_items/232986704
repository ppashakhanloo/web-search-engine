The C-logit model has a simple closed-form analytical probability expression and requires relatively lower calibration efforts and represents a more realistic route choice behaviour compared with the multinomial logit model. This article proposes two versions of the C-logit SUE model that captures the route similarity using different attributes in the commonality factors. The two versions differ with respect to the independence assumption between cost and flow. The corresponding stochastic traffic equilibrium models are called the length-based and congestion-based C-logit SUE models, respectively. To formulate the length-based C-logit SUE model, an equivalent mathematical programming formulation is proposed. For the congestion-based C-logit SUE model, we provide two equivalent variational inequality formulations. To solve the proposed formulations, a new self-adaptive gradient projection algorithm is developed. The proposed formulations and new solution algorithm are tested in two well-known networks. Numerical results demonstrate the validity of the formulations and solution algorithm.", "authors": ["Zhong Zhou", "Anthony Chen", "Shlomo Bekhor"], "citations": [275412677, 274137597, 260523058, 235781758, 257298852, 220469703, 254323797, 251530786, 229887050, 235781785], "id": 232986704}
