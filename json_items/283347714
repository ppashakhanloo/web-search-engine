In experiment 1, dairy bulls were housed in an uninsulated barn (two groups of five bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or at pasture (groups of four and five bulls, 5000 m 2 /paddock). In experiment 2, Hereford bulls were housed in an unin-sulated barn (three groups of four or five bulls, 32 m 2 /pen) or at pasture (three groups of five bulls, 5000 m 2 /pad-dock). There were no differences in drinking, social licking, butting, other social behaviour, self-licking or idling between the UB and PAS bulls. The UB bulls spent more time in lying, ruminating, oral explorative and manipulative behaviour and rubbing and less time foraging and walking than the PAS bulls. The UB bulls performed more social licking and oral manipulation of objects and less mounting than the PAS bulls. These differences resulted most probably from the different feeding regimes and different space allowances.", "authors": ["Leena Tuomisto", "Jaakko Mononen", "Paula Martiskainen", "Leena Ahola", "Arto Huuskonen"], "citations": [], "id": 283347714}
