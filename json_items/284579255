{"references": [], "title": "Parallel Predictive Entropy Search for Batch Global Optimization of Expensive Objective Functions", "abstract": "  We develop parallel predictive entropy search (PPES), a novel algorithm for\nBayesian optimization of expensive black-box objective functions. At each\niteration, PPES aims to select a batch of points which will maximize the\ninformation gain about the global maximizer of the objective. Well known\nstrategies exist for suggesting a single evaluation point based on previous\nobservations, while far fewer are known for selecting batches of points to\nevaluate in parallel. The few batch selection schemes that have been studied\nall resort to greedy methods to compute an optimal batch. To the best of our\nknowledge, PPES is the first non-greedy batch Bayesian optimization strategy.\nWe demonstrate the benefit of this approach in optimization performance on both\nsynthetic and real world applications, including problems in machine learning,\nrocket science and robotics.
