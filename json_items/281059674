In practice, however, alternative models are often proposed that sacrifice stationarity in favour of the greater modelling flexibility required by many real-life applications. We present a family of time-homogeneous Markov processes with nonparametric stationary densities, which retain the desirable statistical properties for inference, while achieving substantial modelling flexibility, matching those achievable with certain non-stationary models. A latent extension of the model enables exact inference through a trans-dimensional Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Numerical illustrations are presented.", "authors": ["Isadora Antoniano‚ÄêVillalobos", "Stephen G. Walker"], "citations": [], "id": 281059674}
