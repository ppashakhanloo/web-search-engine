We develop\npopulation variational Bayes, a new approach for using Bayesian modeling to\nanalyze streams of data. It approximates a new type of distribution, the\npopulation posterior, which combines the notion of a population distribution of\nthe data with Bayesian inference in a probabilistic model. We study our method\nwith latent Dirichlet allocation and Dirichlet process mixtures on several\nlarge-scale data sets.", "authors": ["James McInerney", "Rajesh Ranganath", "David M.
