However, the existing VB algorithms are\nrestricted to cases where the likelihood is tractable, which precludes the use\nof VB in many interesting models such as in state space models and in\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC), where application of VB methods was\npreviously impossible. This paper extends the scope of application of VB to\ncases where the likelihood is intractable, but can be estimated unbiasedly. The\nproposed VB method therefore makes it possible to carry out Bayesian inference\nin many statistical models, including state space models and ABC. The method is\ngeneric in the sense that it can be applied to almost all statistical models\nwithout requiring a model-based derivation, which is a drawback of many\nexisting VB algorithms. We also show how the proposed method can be used to\nobtain highly accurate VB approximations of marginal posterior distributions.", "authors": ["Minh-Ngoc Tran", "David J.
