We propose a multiscale Bernstein polynomial family of\npriors, which produce smooth realizations that do not rely on hard partitioning\nof the support. At each level in an infinitely-deep binary tree, we place a\nbeta dictionary density; within a scale the densities are equivalent to\nBernstein polynomials. Using a stick-breaking characterization, stochastically\ndecreasing weights are allocated to the finer scale dictionary elements. A\nslice sampler is used for posterior computation, and properties are described.\nThe method characterizes densities with locally-varying smoothness, and can\nproduce a sequence of coarse to fine density estimates. An extension for\nBayesian testing of group differences is introduced and applied to DNA\nmethylation array data.", "authors": ["Antonio Canale", "David B. Dunson"], "citations": [], "id": 266477603}
