We show that these priors are extremely flexible, allowing us to generate a great variety of models while preserv-ing computational simplicity. Particular emphasis is placed on the construction of rich temporal and spatial processes, which are applied to two problems in finance and ecology.", "authors": ["Abel Rodr√≠guez", "David B.
