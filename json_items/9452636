The data ranged over a variety of types, biologically and mathematically, but were ‘complex’(with several independent variables). This empirical study leads one to assume, very unequivocally, that there is no practical difference in analyses using these four transformations.\nI thank Drs Daphne Trasler and Dorothy Warburton for permission to quote unpublished data and the McGill Computing Centre for advice and assistance.", "authors": ["A F NAYLOR"], "citations": [233657542, 200806059, 224839719, 17133875, 17133876, 51789935, 17815968, 18029768, 18411865, 18727044], "id": 9452636}
