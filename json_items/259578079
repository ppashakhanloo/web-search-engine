Naive\nimplementations of stochastic approximation suffer from high variance in this\nsetting. Several authors have therefore suggested using control variates to\nreduce this variance, while we have taken a different but analogous approach to\nreducing the variance which we call stochastic linear regression. In this note\nwe take the former perspective and derive the ideal set of control variates for\nstochastic approximation variational Bayes under a certain set of assumptions.\nWe then show that using these control variates is closely related to using the\nstochastic linear regression approximation technique we proposed earlier. A toy\nexample shows that our method for constructing control variates leads to\nstochastic estimators with much lower variance.", "authors": ["Tim Salimans"], "citations": [262991675, 278048531, 289587906], "id": 259578079}
