We show how GPs can be vari- ationally\ndecomposed to depend on a set of globally relevant inducing variables which\nfactorize the model in the necessary manner to perform variational inference.\nOur ap- proach is readily extended to models with non-Gaussian likelihoods and\nlatent variable models based around Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the\napproach on a simple toy problem and two real world data sets.", "authors": ["James Hensman", "Nicolo Fusi", "Neil D.
