Despite this trend, however, the proposition that methods based on local search may be a good alternative approach -- with the advantages of ease-of-use and lower computational overhead -- has not been thoroughly tested. In this thesis we develop a novel, local-sear& algorithm for Pareto optimization, called PAES, enabling us to test and compare MOEAs against this philosophically different search method.", "authors": ["Joshua D.
