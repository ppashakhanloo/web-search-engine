We\noffer in this paper a useful generalisation of the Delayed Acceptance approach,\ndevised to reduce the computational costs of such algorithms by a simple and\nuniversal divide-and-conquer strategy. The idea behind the generic acceleration\nis to divide the acceptance step into several parts, aiming at a major\nreduction in computing time that out-ranks the corresponding reduction in\nacceptance probability. Each of the components can be sequentially compared\nwith a uniform variate, the first rejection signalling that the proposed value\nis considered no further. We develop moreover theoretical bounds for the\nvariance of associated estimators with respect to the variance of the standard\nMetropolis-Hastings and detail some results on optimal scaling and general\noptimisation of the procedure. We illustrate those accelerating features on a\nseries of examples", "authors": ["Marco Banterle", "Clara Grazian", "Anthony Lee", "Christian P. Robert"], "citations": [274730206], "id": 273157850}
