These methods have some,connection with previously proposed importance sampling (IS) and interacting particle system (IPS) methodologies, particularly those of [8, 4], but differ significantly from previous approaches,in a number,of respects: especially in that they operate directly on the path space of the Markov process of interest.", "authors": ["Adam M.
