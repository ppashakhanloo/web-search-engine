Recently, high-dimensional parametric\nmodels like convolutional neural networks have succeeded in building rich\nrepresentations using either compressive, reconstructive or supervised\ncriteria. However, the semantic structure inherent in observations is\noftentimes lost in the process. Human perception excels at understanding\nsemantics but cannot always be expressed in terms of labels. Human-in-the-loop\nsystems like crowdsourcing are often employed to generate similarity\nconstraints using an implicit similarity function encoded in human perception.\nWe propose to combine generative unsupervised feature learning with learning\nfrom similarity orderings in order to learn models which take advantage of\nprivileged information coming from the crowd. We use a fast variational\nalgorithm to learn the model on standard datasets and demonstrate applicability\nto two image datasets, where classification is drastically improved. We show\nhow triplet-samples of the crowd can supplement labels as a source of\ninformation to shape latent spaces with rich semantic information.", "authors": ["Theofanis Karaletsos", "Serge Belongie", "Gunnar RÃ¤tsch"], "citations": [], "id": 278733876}
