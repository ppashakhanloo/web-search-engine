Our new method results in significant speedups on real world text corpora. Conventional Gibbs sampling schemes for LDA require O(K) operations per sam- ple where K is the number of topics in the model. Our proposed method draws equivalent samples but requires on average significantly less then K operations per sample. On real-word corpora FastLDA can be as much as 8 times faster than the standard collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA. No ap- proximations are necessary, and we show that our fast sam- pling scheme produces exactly the same results as the stan- dard (but slower) sampling scheme. Experiments on four real world data sets demonstrate speedups for a wide range of collection sizes. For the PubMed collection of over 8 mil- lion documents with a required computation time of 6 CPU months for LDA, our speedup of 5.7 can save 5 CPU months of computation.", "authors": ["Ian Porteous", "David Newman", "Alexander T.
