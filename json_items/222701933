It shows, under certain continuity and strict monotonicity assumptions on the link cost function, that the UE link flow is a continuous function of the inputs, that the set of UE route flows is a continuous multifunction of the inputs, and that the UE route flow selected to maximize an objective function with certain properties is a continuous function of the inputs. The maximum entropy UE route flow is an example of the last. On the other hand, a UE route flow arbitrarily generated in a standard traffic assignment procedure may not bear such continuity property, as demonstrated by an example in this paper.", "authors": ["Shu Lu", "Yu (Marco) Nie"], "citations": [264983133, 259535754, 272718492, 258383412, 275985328, 257044533, 241084122, 257591221, 264360401, 262223903], "id": 222701933}
