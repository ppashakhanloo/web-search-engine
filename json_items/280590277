The algorithm is based on UCB, but with a carefully chosen confidence\nparameter that optimally balances the risk of failing confidence intervals\nagainst the cost of excessive optimism. A brief empirical evaluation suggests\nthe new algorithm is at least competitive with Thompson sampling.", "authors": ["Tor Lattimore"], "citations": [284219230], "id": 280590277}
