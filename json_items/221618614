The analysis shows distinct tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-sc ale learning problems. Small-scale learning problems are subject to the usual approximation-estimation tradeoff. Large-scale learning problems are subject to a qualitatively different tradeoff involving the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithms in non-trivial ways.", "authors": ["Léon Bottou", "Olivier Bousquet"], "citations": [291186593, 282863279, 280873163, 280498476, 279633530, 272385688, 277023572, 273918384, 274730183, 273067814], "id": 221618614}
