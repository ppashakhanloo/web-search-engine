These features allow it to converge to\nhigh-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods\nsuch as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is\nhighly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\\epsilon} and a\ndesired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm\nexhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the\nalgorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an\nextension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses\na recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a\nwide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to\ndouble back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as\nefficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC\nmethod, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also\nderive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\\epsilon} on the fly\nbased on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at\nall. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic\ninference engines that require efficient \"turnkey\" sampling algorithms.", "authors": ["Matthew D.
