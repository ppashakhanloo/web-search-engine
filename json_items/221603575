However, many relational inference algorithms proceed by first fully instantiating the first-order theory a nd then working at the propositional level. The applicability of such approaches is severely limited by the exponential time and memory cost of propositionalization. Singla and Domin- gos (2006) addressed this by developing a \"lazy\" version of the WalkSAT algorithm, which grounds atoms and clauses only as needed. In this paper we generalize their ideas to a much broader class of algorithms, including other types of SAT solvers and probabilistic inference methods like MCMC. Lazy inference is potentially applicable whenever variables and functions have default values (i.e., a value that is much more frequent than the others). In relational domains, the default is false for atoms and true for clauses. We illustrat e our framework by applying it to MC-SAT, a state-of-the-art MCMC algorithm. Experiments on a number of real-world domains show that lazy inference reduces both space and time by several orders of magnitude, making probabilistic rela- tional inference applicable in previously infeasible domains.", "authors": ["Hoifung Poon", "Pedro Domingos", "Marc Sumner"], "citations": [275346233, 261040911, 221653537, 221417870, 221604130, 220874817, 221609526, 235673412, 221012925, 266232557], "id": 221603575}
