To discover the connections between emotions evoked in a user by varied-scale documents effectively, the paper is concerned with the problem of sentiment analysis over online news. Different from previous models which treat training documents uniformly, a weighted multi-label classification model (WMCM) is proposed by introducing the concept of \" emotional concentration \" to estimate the weight of training documents, in addition to tackle the issue of noisy samples for each emotion. The topic assignment is also used to distinguish different emotional senses of the same word at the semantic level. Experimental evaluations using short news headlines and long documents validate the effectiveness of the proposed WMCM for sentiment prediction.", "authors": ["Xin Li", "Haoran Xie", "Yanghui Rao", "Yanjia Chen", "Xuebo Liu", "Huan Huang", "Fu Lee Wang"], "citations": [], "id": 290911815}
