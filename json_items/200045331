Kalman published his famous paper describing a recursive\nsolution to the discrete-data linear filtering problem. Since that\ntime, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman\nfilter has been the subject of extensive research and application,\nparticularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation.\n\nThe Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides\nan efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state\nof a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error.\nThe filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations\nof past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when\nthe precise nature of the modeled system is unknown.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to\nthe discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description\nand some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation,\ndescription and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and\na relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers & results.", "authors": ["Greg Welch", "Gary Bishop"], "citations": [283777035, 288991728, 283665452, 281791022, 283663059, 281457252, 282867496, 282185570, 281272208, 281514364], "id": 200045331}
