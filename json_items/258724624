A wide variety of methods and\ntools have been introduced for surrogate modeling aiming to develop and\nutilize computationally more efficient surrogates of high-fidelity\nmodels mostly in optimization frameworks. This paper reviews, analyzes,\nand categorizes research efforts on surrogate modeling and applications\nwith an emphasis on the research accomplished in the water resources\nfield. The review analyzes 48 references on surrogate modeling arising\nfrom water resources and also screens out more than 100 references from\nthe broader research community. Two broad families of surrogates namely\nresponse surface surrogates, which are statistical or empirical\ndata-driven models emulating the high-fidelity model responses, and\nlower-fidelity physically based surrogates, which are simplified models\nof the original system, are detailed in this paper. Taxonomies on\nsurrogate modeling frameworks, practical details, advances, challenges,\nand limitations are outlined. Important observations and some guidance\nfor surrogate modeling decisions are provided along with a list of\nimportant future research directions that would benefit the common\nsampling and search (optimization) analyses found in water resources.", "authors": ["Saman Razavi", "Bryan A.
