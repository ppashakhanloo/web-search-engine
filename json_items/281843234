The search for the best fit of these algorithms is an important task and a major research challenge in the field of metaheuristics. The fine-tuning process requires a robust statistical approach, in order to aid in the process understanding and also in the effective settings, as well as an efficient algorithm which can summarize the search process. This paper aims to present an approach combining design of experiments (DOE) techniques and racing algorithms to improve the performance of different algorithms to solve classical optimization problems. The results comparison considering the default metaheuristics and ones using the settings suggested by the fine-tuning procedure will be presented. Broadly, the statistical results suggest that the fine-tuning process improves the quality of solutions for different instances of the studied problems. Therefore, by means of this study it can be concluded that the use of DOE techniques combined with racing algorithms may be a promising and powerful tool to assist in the investigation, and in the fine-tuning of different algorithms. However, additional studies must be conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.", "authors": ["Eduardo Batista de Moraes Barbosa", "Edson Luiz Fran√ßa Senne", "Messias Borges silva"], "citations": [], "id": 281843234}
