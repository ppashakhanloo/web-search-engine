We show that,\nwith a Gaussian mixture model, the approach is able to select an\n“optimal” number of components in the model and so partition\ndata sets. The performance of the Bayesian method is compared to other\nmethods of optimal model selection and found to give good results. The\nmethods are tested on synthetic and real data sets", "authors": ["Stephen J.
