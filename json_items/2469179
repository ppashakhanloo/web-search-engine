It is assumed that the ordinal data arise from an underlying latent variable which is related to a set of covariates in a generalized linear model sense. The link function which associates the class probabilities to the set of covariates is estimated as a finite mixture of probit links, thereby introducing flexibility in the choice of the link function. The Bayesian model provides an easy-to-implement simulation environment and therefore avoids pitfalls of the expensive and numerically unstable maximum likelihood analysis. The class probabilities are estimated by considering the predictive distribution of a future observation given the set of covariates. Computations are performed using Gibbs sampling. The method is illustrated by using both simulated and real data sets.", "authors": ["Alaattin Erkanli", "Dalene Stangl", "Peter Muller"], "citations": [51403714, 2470994, 228623852, 2719888, 2663884, 2819359, 268649728, 2468788, 2469229, 4746299], "id": 2469179}
