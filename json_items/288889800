In order to run ML algorithms at such scales, on a\ndistributed cluster with 10s to 1000s of machines, it is often the case that\nsignificant engineering efforts are required --- and one might fairly ask if\nsuch engineering truly falls within the domain of ML research or not. Taking\nthe view that Big ML systems can benefit greatly from ML-rooted statistical and\nalgorithmic insights --- and that ML researchers should therefore not shy away\nfrom such systems design --- we discuss a series of principles and strategies\ndistilled from our recent efforts on industrial-scale ML solutions. These\nprinciples and strategies span a continuum from application, to engineering,\nand to theoretical research and development of Big ML systems and\narchitectures, with the goal of understanding how to make them efficient,\ngenerally-applicable, and supported with convergence and scaling guarantees.\nThey concern four key questions which traditionally receive little attention in\nML research: How to distribute an ML program over a cluster? How to bridge ML\ncomputation with inter-machine communication? How to perform such\ncommunication? What should be communicated between machines? By exposing\nunderlying statistical and algorithmic characteristics unique to ML programs\nbut not typically seen in traditional computer programs, and by dissecting\nsuccessful cases to reveal how we have harnessed these principles to design and\ndevelop both high-performance distributed ML software as well as\ngeneral-purpose ML frameworks, we present opportunities for ML researchers and\npractitioners to further shape and grow the area that lies between ML and\nsystems.", "authors": ["Eric P.
