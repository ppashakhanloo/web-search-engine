The new method is applicable to high-dimensional data. It\nis based on a nonparametric Bayesian approach in which the number of views and\nthe number of feature-/subject clusters are inferred in a data-driven manner.\nWe simultaneously model different distribution families, such as Gaussian,\nPoisson, and multinomial distributions in each cluster block. This makes our\nmethod applicable to datasets consisting of both numerical and categorical\nvariables, which biomedical data typically do. Clustering solutions are based\non variational inference with mean field approximation. We apply the proposed\nmethod to synthetic and real data, and show that our method outperforms other\nmultiple clustering methods both in recovering true cluster structures and in\ncomputation time. Finally, we apply our method to a depression dataset with no\ntrue cluster structure available, from which useful inferences are drawn about\npossible clustering structures of the data.", "authors": ["Tomoki Tokuda", "Junichiro Yoshimoto", "Yu Shimizu", "Shigeru Toki", "Go Okada", "Masahiro Takamura", "Tetsuya Yamamoto", "Shinpei Yoshimura", "Yasumasa Okamoto", "Shigeto Yamawaki", "Kenji Doya"], "citations": [], "id": 283117782}
