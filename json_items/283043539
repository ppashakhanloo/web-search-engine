Recently, several methods have emerged across disciplines that\ndraw upon optimization and simulation to create computer programs that tailor\nmaterial responses to specified behaviors. However, so far the methods\ndeveloped either involve black-box techniques, in which the optimizer operates\nwithout explicit knowledge of the material's configuration space, or they\nrequire carefully tuned algorithms with applicability limited to a narrow\nsubclass of materials. Here we introduce a formalism that can generate\noptimizers automatically by extending statistical mechanics into the realm of\ndesign. The strength of this new approach lies in its capability to transform\nstatistical models that describe materials into optimizers to tailor them. By\ncomparing against standard black-box optimization methods, we demonstrate how\noptimizers generated by this formalism can be faster and more effective, while\nremaining straightforward to implement. The scope of our approach includes new\npossibilities for solving a variety of complex optimization and design problems\nconcerning materials both in and out of equilibrium.", "authors": ["Marc Z.
