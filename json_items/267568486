This method is equivariant with respect to relabeling units; unsampled units do not interfere with sampled data; and missing data do not hinder infer-ence. Cluster inference using the posterior mode performs well on simulated and real data sets, 10 and the posterior predictive distribution enables supervised learning based on a partial clustering of the sample.", "authors": ["Harry Crane"], "citations": [280311472], "id": 267568486}
