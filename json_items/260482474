{"references": [], "title": "SMERED: A Bayesian Approach to Graphical Record Linkage and De-duplication", "abstract": "We propose a novel unsupervised approach for linking records across\narbitrarily many files, while simultaneously detecting duplicate records within\nfiles. Our key innovation is to represent the pattern of links between records\nas a {\\em bipartite} graph, in which records are directly linked to latent true\nindividuals, and only indirectly linked to other records. This flexible new\nrepresentation of the linkage structure naturally allows us to estimate the\nattributes of the unique observable people in the population, calculate $k$-way\nposterior probabilities of matches across records, and propagate the\nuncertainty of record linkage into later analyses. Our linkage structure lends\nitself to an efficient, linear-time, hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm,\nwhich overcomes many obstacles encountered by previously proposed methods of\nrecord linkage, despite the high dimensional parameter space. We assess our\nresults on real and simulated data.", "authors": ["Rebecca C. Steorts", "Rob Hall", "Stephen E. Fienberg"], "citations": [267099477, 263891726], "id": 260482474}
