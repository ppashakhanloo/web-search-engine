With the advent of\nsmartphones equipped with acceloremeter, gyroscope and camera; it is now\npossible to develop activity classification platforms everyone can use\nconveniently. In this paper, we propose a fast inference method for an\nunsupervised non-parametric time series model namely variational inference for\nsticky HDP-SLDS(Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical\nSystem). We show that the proposed algorithm can differentiate various indoor\nactivities such as sitting, walking, turning, going up/down the stairs and\ntaking the elevator using only the acceloremeter of an Android smartphone\nSamsung Galaxy S4. We used the front camera of the smartphone to annotate\nactivity types precisely. We compared the proposed method with Hidden Markov\nModels with Gaussian emission probabilities on a dataset of 10 subjects. We\nshowed that the efficacy of the stickiness property. We further compared the\nvariational inference to the Gibbs sampler on the same model and show that\nvariational inference is faster in one order of magnitude.", "authors": ["Mehmet Emin Basbug", "Koray Ozcan", "Senem Velipasalar"], "citations": [], "id": 283043558}
