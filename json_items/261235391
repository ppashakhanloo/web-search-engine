Pleasure orientation of a song is estimated first, and then different regressors are used to predict degree of pleasure according to the estimated orientation. By using corresponding regressors for each instance, there is a big improvement when we assume the first layer is perfect in comparison with one-layer model. By tuning the confidence threshold of the orientation classifier of the two-layer model, we get improvement over one-layer model.", "authors": ["Xing Wang", "Yuqian Wu", "Xiaoou Chen", "Deshun Yang"], "citations": [272521878], "id": 261235391}
