These representations are manifested in terms of an infinite sum of\nwell-behaved (proper) beta and gamma distributions. Further, we demonstrate how\nthese infinite sums may be truncated in practice, and explicitly characterize\ntruncation errors. We also perform an analysis of the characteristics of\nposterior distributions, based on the proposed decompositions. The\ndecompositions provide new insights into the beta and gamma processes (and\ntheir generalizations), and we demonstrate how the proposed representation\nunifies some properties of the two. This paper is meant to provide a rigorous\nfoundation for and new perspectives on Levy processes, as these are of\nincreasing importance in machine learning.", "authors": ["Yingjian Wang", "Lawrence Carin"], "citations": [], "id": 227716415}
