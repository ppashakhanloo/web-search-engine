The problem is modeled and solved as a two-stage stochastic program, where in each period, districting decisions are made in the first stage, and the Beardwood-Halton-Hammersley formula is used to approximate the expected routing cost of each district in the second stage. An enhanced multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA), i.e., the preference-inspired co-evolutionary algorithm using mating restriction, is developed for the problem. The algorithm is tested on randomly generated instances and is compared with two state-of-the-art MOEAs. Computational results confirm the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Moreover, a procedure for selecting a preferred design for the proposed problem is described.", "authors": ["Hongtao Lei", "Rui Wang", "Gilbert Laporte"], "citations": [], "id": 283193499}
