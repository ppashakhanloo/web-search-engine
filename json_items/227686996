The method is based on a model approximation where the approximating intensities have the structure of a piecewise constant function. Random step functions on the plane are generated using Voronoi tessellations of random point patterns. Smoothing between nearby intensity values is applied by means of a Markov random field prior in the spirit of Bayesian image analysis. The performance of the method is illustrated in examples with both real and simulated data.", "authors": ["Juha Heikkinen", "Elja Arjas"], "citations": [24052917, 223457711, 221653841, 227659607, 267246629, 47932762, 228891160, 237539643, 238446177, 238676203], "id": 227686996}
