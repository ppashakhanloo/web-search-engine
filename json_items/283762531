Additionally, a method to measure\nnaturalness can be complementary to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based\nfeatures, which are known to be insensitive to the naturalness of images.\nHowever, most probabilistic image models have insufficient capability of\nmodeling the complex and abstract naturalness that we feel because they are\nbuilt directly on raw image pixels. In this work, we assume that naturalness\ncan be measured by the predictability on high-level features during eye\nmovement. Based on this assumption, we propose a novel method to evaluate the\nnaturalness by building a variant of Recurrent Neural Network Language Models\non pre-trained CNN representations. Our method is applied to two tasks,\ndemonstrating that 1) using our method as a regularizer enables us to generate\nmore understandable images from image features than existing approaches, and 2)\nunnaturalness maps produced by our method achieve state-of-the-art eye fixation\nprediction performance on two well-studied datasets.", "authors": ["Hiroharu Kato", "Tatsuya Harada"], "citations": [], "id": 283762531}
