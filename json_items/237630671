Forest management refers to making decisions about when and where to intervene in the natural growth of forests to achieve objectives, such as enhancing the visual quality of a stand or maximizing timber yield. A prescription is a schedule of thinning treatments applied to stands over a planning horizon. When multiple management goals exist treatment prescription becomes a complex multi- objective problem. The effectiveness of a GA depends on selecting an appropriate representation and germane fitness function. These design decisions are reviewed, followed by a series of experiments testing the performance of the GA. Different parameter settings are compared and the GA is contrasted with some other heuristic search methods. The final experiment compares a plan created by the GA to a plan recommended by a human expert.", "authors": ["JOHN DEWEY"], "citations": [], "id": 237630671}
