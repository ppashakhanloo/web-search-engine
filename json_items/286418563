To effectively establish the energy consumption pattern of a machine tool over time, the energy prediction model is continuously updated with new measurement data to account for time-varying effects of the machine tool, such as tool wear and machine tool deterioration. In this work, a real-time data collection and processing framework is developed to retrieve raw data from a milling machine tool and its sensors and convert them into relevant input features. The extracted input features are then used to construct the energy prediction model using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. To update the GP regression model with real-time streaming data, we investigate the use of sparse representation of the covariance matrix to reduce the computational and storage demands of the GP regression. We compare computational efficiency of sparse GP to that of full GP regression model and show the effectiveness of the sparse GP regression model for tracking the variation in the energy consumption pattern of the target machine.
