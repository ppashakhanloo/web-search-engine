The problem is formulated in a probabilistic model and an auto-calibration sparse Bayesian learning algorithm is proposed. In this algorithm, signal and perturbation are iteratively estimated to achieve sparsity by leveraging a variational Bayesian expectation maximization technique. Results from numerical experiments have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm has achieved improvements on the accuracy of signal reconstruction.", "authors": ["Lifan Zhao", "Guoan Bi", "Lu Wang", "Haijian Zhang"], "citations": [266735007, 260507823, 260524441, 262025491, 271457774, 265911338, 260872542, 262527854, 273139744, 266749846], "id": 260637032}
