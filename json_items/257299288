However, when several (competing) objectives are\nconsidered, choosing an appropriate sampling strategy remains an open question.\nWe present here a new algorithm based on stepwise uncertainty reduction\nprinciples to address this issue. Optimization is seen as a sequential\nreduction of the volume of the excursion sets below the current best solutions,\nand our sampling strategy chooses the points that give the highest expected\nreduction. Closed-form formulae are provided to compute the sampling criterion,\navoiding the use of cumbersome simulations. We test our method on numerical\nexamples, showing that it provides an efficient trade-off between exploration\nand intensification.", "authors": ["Victor Picheny"], "citations": [281985308, 264936662, 264232948, 282570552], "id": 257299288}
