We prove powerful and flexible bounds on the\ndistance of the $n$th step distributions of two Markov chains when one of them\nsatisfies a Wasserstein ergodicity condition. Our work is motivated by the\nrecent interest in approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in the\nanalysis of big data sets. By using an approach based on Lyapunov functions, we\nprovide estimates for geometrically ergodic Markov chains under weak\nassumptions. In an autoregressive model, our bounds cannot be improved in\ngeneral. We illustrate our theory by showing quantitative estimates for\napproximate versions of two prominent MCMC algorithms, the Metropolis-Hastings\nand stochastic Langevin algorithms.", "authors": ["Daniel Rudolf", "Nikolaus Schweizer"], "citations": [279062934], "id": 273640145}
