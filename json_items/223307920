FORM or SORM approximations at each design point followed by a series system reliability analysis is shown to lead to improved estimates of the failure probability. Three example applications show the generality and robustness of the method.", "authors": ["Armen Der Kiureghian", "Taleen Dakessian"], "citations": [274312193, 255736695, 259517885, 281922303, 51888191, 228373395, 256918041, 225553742, 227295038, 228667891], "id": 223307920}
