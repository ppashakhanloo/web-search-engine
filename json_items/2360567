Techniques such as gradient descent are helpful in searching through the space of models, but problems such as local minima, and more importantly, lack of a distance metric between various models reduce the applicability of these search methods. Hoeffding Races is a technique for finding a good model for the data by quickly discarding bad models, and concentrating the computational effort at differentiating between the better ones. This paper focuses on the special case of leave-one-out cross validation applied to memorybased learning algorithms, but we also argue that it is applicable to any class of model selection problems. 1 Introduction Model selection addresses \"high level\" decisions about how best to tune learning algorithm architectures for particular tasks. Such decisions include which...", "authors": ["Oded Maron", "Andrew W.
