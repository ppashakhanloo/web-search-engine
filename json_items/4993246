However, these advances have not received a full critical and comparative analysis of their scope, impact and limitations in statistical modelling; many aspects of the theory and methods remain a mystery to practitioners and many open questions remain. In this paper, we discuss and illustrate the rich modelling and analytic possibilities that are available to the statistician within the Bayesian nonparametric and/or semiparametric framework.", "authors": ["Stephen G.
