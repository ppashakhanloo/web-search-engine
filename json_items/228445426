Eng. Mech., 2001) has become one of the most\npopular method to solve it. Subset simulation has been shown to provide\nsignificant savings in the number of simulations to achieve a given accuracy of\nestimation, with respect to many other Monte Carlo approaches. The number of\nsimulations remains still quite high however, and this method can be\nimpractical for applications where an expensive-to-evaluate computer model is\ninvolved. We propose a new algorithm, called Bayesian Subset Simulation, that\ntakes the best from the Subset Simulation algorithm and from sequential\nBayesian methods based on kriging (also known as Gaussian process modeling).\nThe performance of this new algorithm is illustrated using a test case from the\nliterature. We are able to report promising results. In addition, we provide a\nnumerical study of the statistical properties of the estimator.", "authors": ["Ling Li", "Julien Bect", "Emmanuel Vazquez"], "citations": [281895996, 228438518, 241707735, 262983676, 262265054, 281985308, 266943935, 282570552], "id": 228445426}
