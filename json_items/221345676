Given a flxed Bayesian network structure, pa- rameters learning can take two difierent approaches: generative and discriminative learning. While generative parameter learn- ing is more e-cient, discriminative param- eter learning is more efiective. In this pa- per, we propose a simple, e-cient, and efiective discriminative parameter learning method, called Discriminative Frequency Es- timate (DFE), which learns parameters by discriminatively computing frequencies from data. Empirical studies show that the DFE algorithm integrates the advantages of both generative and discriminative learning: it performs as well as the state-of-the-art dis- criminative parameter learning method ELR in accuracy, but is signiflcantly more e-cient.", "authors": ["Jiang Su", "Harry Zhang", "Charles X.
