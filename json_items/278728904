This paper considers the blind FH signal estimation problem in antenna array systems, where the direction-of-arrivals, hopping time and frequency are all unknown to the users. A hierarchical sparsity-aware technique is developed to estimate these parameters in an optimization framework. More concretely, sparsity in spatial domain and time-frequency domain are exploited in a hierarchical and iterative manner, respectively, where more accurate parameter estimation performance can be obtained. Compared to prior state-of-the-arts, conventional model-order selection procedure can be conveniently avoided due to the utilization of sparsity-regularized framework. Results of numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance particularly in sub-Nyquist sampling and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios compared with other recently reported ones.", "authors": ["Lifan Zhao", "Lu Wang", "Bi Guoan", "Haijian Zhang"], "citations": [], "id": 278728904}
