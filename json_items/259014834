The paper\nidentifies these difficulties, reviews ways of coping with them in\npractice, and discusses in detail a class of methods with a Monte Carlo\nflavour. Their performance on simple examples suggests that they should\nbe valuable, practically feasible procedures in the context of a range\nof otherwise intractable problems.
