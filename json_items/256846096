It\nshows, using the so called parameter separation parameterization, a simple\ncriterion under which the variational method works well. Based on this\nframework, its provides a full variational solution for the Dirichlet process.\nThe numerical results show that the method is very computationally efficient\nwhen compared to MCMC. Finally, we propose an empirical method to estimate the\ntruncation level for the truncated Dirichlet process.", "authors": ["Hui Zhao", "Paul Marriott"], "citations": [], "id": 256846096}
