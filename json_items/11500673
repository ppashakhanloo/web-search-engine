The method is based on a combination of a Bayesian on-line algorithm, together with a sequential construction of a relevant subsample of the data that fully specifies the prediction of the GP model. By using an appealing parameterization and projection techniques in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, recursions for the effective parameters and a sparse gaussian approximation of the posterior process are obtained. This allows for both a propagation of predictions and Bayesian error measures. The significance and robustness of our approach are demonstrated on a variety of experiments.", "authors": ["Lehel Csat√≥", "Manfred Opper"], "citations": [277324885, 278329367, 267157313, 265967011, 265967012, 263124732, 262560295, 261700410, 263593840, 262148785], "id": 11500673}
