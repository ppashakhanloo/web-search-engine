However, it is a somewhat strange introduction because it contains a description of the most general algorithm of all. The next chapter (Chapter 8) concentrates on the more specific slice sampler, which then introduces the Gibbs sampler (Chapters 9 and 10), which, in turn, is a special case of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. (However, the Gibbs sampler is different in both fundamental methodology and historical motivation.)", "authors": ["Christian P. Robert"], "citations": [], "id": 274730206}
