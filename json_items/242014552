The algorithm, termed Compressive Adaptive Sense and\nSearch (CASS), is shown to be near-optimal in that it succeeds at the lowest\npossible signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) levels. Like traditional compressed\nsensing based on random non-adaptive design matrices, the CASS algorithm\nrequires only k log n measurements to recover a k-sparse signal of dimension n.\nHowever, CASS succeeds at SNR levels that are a factor log n less than required\nby standard compressed sensing. From the point of view of constructing and\nimplementing the sensing operation as well as computing the reconstruction, the\nproposed algorithm is substantially less computationally intensive than\nstandard compressed sensing. CASS is also demonstrated to perform considerably\nbetter in practice through simulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first demonstration of an adaptive compressed sensing algorithm with\nnear-optimal theoretical guarantees and excellent practical performance. This\npaper also shows that methods like compressed sensing, group testing, and\npooling have an advantage beyond simply reducing the number of measurements or\ntests -- adaptive versions of such methods can also improve detection and\nestimation performance when compared to non-adaptive direct (uncompressed)\nsensing.", "authors": ["Matthew L.
