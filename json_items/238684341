In the past there have been computational difficulties with this model. This article solves the computational difficulties by developing a “Gibbs sampler” algorithm. The estimator developed in this article is then compared to parametric empirical Bayes estimators (PEB) and nonparametric empirical Bayes estimators (NPEB) in a Monte Carlo study. The Monte Carlo study demonstrates that in some conditions the PEB is better than the NPEB and in other conditions the NPEB is better than the PEB. The Monte Carlo study also shows that the estimator developed in this article produces estimates that are about as good as the PEB when the PEB is better and produces estimates that are as good as the NPEB estimator when that method is better.", "authors": ["Michael D.
