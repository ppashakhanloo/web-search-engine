For this purpose, several online sparsification criteria have been\nproposed to restrict the model definition on a subset of samples. The most\nknown criterion is the (linear) approximation criterion, which discards any\nsample that can be well represented by the already contributing samples, an\noperation with excessive computational complexity. Several computationally\nefficient sparsification criteria have been introduced in the literature, such\nas the distance, the coherence and the Babel criteria. In this paper, we\nprovide a framework that connects these sparsification criteria to the issue of\napproximating samples, by deriving theoretical bounds on the approximation\nerrors. Moreover, we investigate the error of approximating any feature, by\nproposing upper-bounds on the approximation error for each of the\naforementioned sparsification criteria. Two classes of features are described\nin detail, the empirical mean and the principal axes in the kernel principal\ncomponent analysis.", "authors": ["Paul Honeine"], "citations": [267759699], "id": 265967012}
