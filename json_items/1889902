It is shown how the Girsanov theorem can be used for evaluating the likelihood ratios needed in importance sampling. It is also shown how the methodology can be applied to a class of models, where the driving noise process is lower in the dimensionality than the state and thus the laws of state and noise are not absolutely continuous. Rao-Blackwellization of conditionally Gaussian models and unknown static parameter models is also considered.", "authors": ["Simo Särkkä", "Tommi Sottinen"], "citations": [264197875, 261988241, 275071055, 235666472, 267791221, 242721020, 233400398, 252204247, 263864415, 234070443], "id": 1889902}
