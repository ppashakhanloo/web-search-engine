In the limit $n \\to \\infty$, it is well-known that, when the\nvariance of the proposal scales inversely proportional to the dimension $n$\nwhereas time is accelerated by the factor $n$, a diffusive limit is obtained\nfor each component of the Markov chain if this chain starts at equilibrium.\nThis paper extends this result when the initial distribution is not the target\nprobability measure. Remarking that the interaction between the components of\nthe chain due to the common acceptance/rejection of the proposed moves is of\nmean-field type, we obtain a propagation of chaos result under the same scaling\nas in the stationary case. This proves that, in terms of the dimension $n$, the\nsame scaling holds for the transient phase of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\nas near stationarity. The diffusive and mean-field limit of each component is a\nnonlinear diffusion process in the sense of McKean. This opens the route to new\ninvestigations of the optimal choice for the variance of the proposal\ndistribution in order to accelerate convergence to equilibrium.", "authors": ["Benjamin Jourdain", "Tony Leli√®vre", "Blazej Miasojedow"], "citations": [233967527, 262489444, 279062934], "id": 232718818}
