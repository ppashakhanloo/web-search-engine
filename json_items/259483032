The new algorithm, called Monte Carlo non-local\nmeans (MCNLM), speeds up the classical NLM by computing a small subset of image\npatch distances, which are randomly selected according to a designed sampling\npattern. We make two contributions. First, we analyze the performance of the\nMCNLM algorithm and show that, for large images or large external image\ndatabases, the random outcomes of MCNLM are tightly concentrated around the\ndeterministic full NLM result. In particular, our error probability bounds show\nthat, at any given sampling ratio, the probability for MCNLM to have a large\ndeviation from the original NLM solution decays exponentially as the size of\nthe image or database grows. Second, we derive explicit formulas for optimal\nsampling patterns that minimize the error probability bound by exploiting\npartial knowledge of the pairwise similarity weights. Numerical experiments\nshow that MCNLM is competitive with other state-of-the-art fast NLM algorithms\nfor single-image denoising. When applied to denoising images using an external\ndatabase containing ten billion patches, MCNLM returns a randomized solution\nthat is within 0.2 dB of the full NLM solution while reducing the runtime by\nthree orders of magnitude.", "authors": ["Stanley H.
