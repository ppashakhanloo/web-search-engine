We present in\ndetail the structure of a manually segmented and annotated corpus including\nover 160 hours of German broadcast news, and propose it as an evaluation\nframework of LVCSR systems. We show our own experimental results on the corpus,\nachieved with a state-of-the-art LVCSR decoder, measuring the effect of\ndifferent feature sets and decoding parameters, and thereby demonstrate that\nreal-time decoding of our test set is feasible on a desktop PC at 9.2% word\nerror rate.", "authors": ["Felix Weninger", "Björn Schuller", "Florian Eyben", "Martin Wöllmer", "Gerhard Rigoll"], "citations": [277086605], "id": 269636311}
