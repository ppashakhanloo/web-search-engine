We first\nintroduce the canonical formulation of the large-scale optimization problem.\nNext, we describe the general form of ADMM and then focus on several direct\nextensions and sophisticated modifications of ADMM from $2$-block to $N$-block\nsettings to deal with the optimization problem. The iterative schemes and\nconvergence properties of each extension/modification are given, and the\nimplementation on large-scale computing facilities is also illustrated.\nFinally, we numerate several applications in power system for distributed\nrobust state estimation, network energy management and security constrained\noptimal power flow problem.", "authors": ["Lanchao Liu", "Zhu Han"], "citations": [281716838, 284227375], "id": 273067814}
