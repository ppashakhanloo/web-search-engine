The new estimation\nalgorithm can be used to approximate any posterior without relying on conjugate\npriors. We propose a divide and recombine strategy for the analysis of large\ndatasets, which partitions a large dataset into smaller pieces and then\ncombines the variational distributions that have been learnt in parallel on\neach separate piece using the hybrid Variational Bayes algorithm. The proposed\nmethod is applied to fitting generalized linear mixed models. The computational\nefficiency of the parallel and hybrid Variational Bayes algorithm is\ndemonstrated on several simulated and real datasets.", "authors": ["Minh-Ngoc Tran", "David J.
