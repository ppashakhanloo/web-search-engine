This system was used in the 2007 National Institute of Standards\nand Technology (NIST) Rich Transcription evaluation. The ICSI system automatically performs both speaker segmentation and\nclustering without any prior knowledge of the identities or the number of speakers. Our system uses “standard” speech processing \ncomponents and techniques such as HMMs, agglomerative clustering, and the Bayesian Information Criterion. However, we have\ndeveloped the system with an eye towards robustness and ease of portability. Thus we have avoided the use of any sort of model\nthat requires training on “outside” data and we have attempted to develop algorithms that require as little tuning as possible.\n\nThe system is simular to last year’s system [1] except for three aspects. We used the most recent available version of the\nbeam-forming toolkit, we implemented a new speech/non-speech detector that does not require models trained on meeting data\nand we performed our development on a much larger set of recordings.", "authors": ["Chuck Wooters", "Marijn Huijbregts"], "citations": [272477173, 269299167, 260693019, 224223971, 220655267, 220655863, 230708615, 224236323, 51574320, 260693306], "id": 221545724}
