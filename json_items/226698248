In contrast to pairwise interaction processes, this model has interaction terms of all orders. The likelihood is closely related to the empty space functionF, paralleling the relation between the Strauss process and Ripley'sK-function. We show that, in complete analogy with pairwise interaction processes, the pseudolikelihood equations for this model are a special case of the Takacs-Fiksel method, and our model is the limit of a sequence of auto-logistic lattice processes.", "authors": ["A.
