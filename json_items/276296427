Therefore, more elaborate methods,\nsuch as ABC with the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (ABC-MCMC), should be\nused. However, the elaboration of a proposal density for MCMC is a sensitive\nissue and very difficult in the ABC setting, where the likelihood is\nintractable. We discuss an automatic proposal distribution useful for ABC-MCMC\nalgorithms. This proposal is inspired by the theory of quasi-likelihood (QL)\nfunctions and is obtained by modelling the distribution of the summary\nstatistics as a function of the parameters. Essentially, given a real-valued\nvector of summary statistics, we reparametrize the model by means of a\nregression function of the statistics on parameters, obtained by sampling from\nthe original model in a pilot-run simulation study. The QL theory is well\nestablished for a scalar parameter, and it is shown that when the conditional\nvariance of the summary statistic is assumed constant, the QL has a closed-form\nnormal density. This idea of constructing proposal distributions is extended to\nnon constant variance and to real-valued parameter vectors. The method is\nillustrated by several examples and by an application to a real problem in\npopulation genetics.", "authors": ["Stefano Cabras", "Maria Eugenia Castellanos Nueda", "Erlis Ruli"], "citations": [], "id": 276296427}
