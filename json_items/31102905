{"references": [], "title": "Nonparametric Bayesian Bioassay Including Ordered Polytomous Response", "abstract": "Previous attempts at implementing fully Bayesian nonparametric bioassay have enjoyed limited success due to computational difficulties. We show here how this problem may be generally handled using a sampling based approach to develop desired marginal posterior distributions and their features. A useful extension is presented which treats the case of ordered polytomous response. Illustrative examples are provided.", "authors": ["ALAN E.
