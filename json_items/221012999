Using a non-parametric version of the HMM, called the infinite HMM (iHMM), we ad- dress the problem of choosing the number of hidden states in unsupervised Markov models for PoS tagging. We experi- ment with two non-parametric priors, the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes, on the Wall Street Journal dataset using a paral- lelized implementation of an iHMM in- ference algorithm. We evaluate the re- sults with a variety of clustering evalua- tion metrics and achieve equivalent or bet- ter performances than previously reported. Building on this promising result we eval- uate the output of the unsupervised PoS tagger as a direct replacement for the out- put of a fully supervised PoS tagger for the task of shallow parsing and compare the two evaluations.", "authors": ["Jurgen Van Gael", "Andreas Vlachos", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "citations": [234131160, 230672506, 224175402, 268006363, 220875098, 221013033, 221012878, 216224619, 255565417, 262277910], "id": 221012999}
