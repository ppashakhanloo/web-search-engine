In spite of numerous applications, such as opinion surveys or\necological counting procedures, few concentration results are known for the\nsetting of sampling without replacement from a finite population. Until now,\nthe best general concentration inequality has been a Hoeffding inequality due\nto Serfling (1974). In this paper, we first improve on the fundamental result\nof Serfling (1974), and further extend it to obtain a Bernstein concentration\nbound for sampling without replacement. We then derive an empirical version of\nour bound that does not require the variance to be known to the user.", "authors": ["RÃ©mi Bardenet", "Odalric-Ambrym Maillard"], "citations": [280589611, 280589952, 267759898, 264708143, 268747974, 279633530, 280970148], "id": 256606492}
