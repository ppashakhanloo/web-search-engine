The two types of Gibbs samplers are quite different in nature. The é rst method is applicable when the prior can be characterized by a generalized Pólya urn mechanism and it involves drawing samples from the poste- rior of a hierarchical model formed by marginalizing over the prior. Our Pólya urn Gibbs sampler is a direct extension of the widely used Pólya urn sampler developed by Escobar (1988, 1994), MacEachern (1994), and Escobar and West (1995) for", "authors": ["Hemant Iswaran"], "citations": [259989855, 257299216, 234113987, 231740120, 228333603, 224926921, 224825374, 241518072, 228793616, 51934885], "id": 27290603}
