The algorithm should be\nparticularly efficient for hierarchical models, for which the EP algorithm\nworks on the shared parameters (hyperparameters) of the model.\nThe central idea of EP is to work at each step with a \"tilted distribution\"\nthat combines the likelihood for a part of the data with the \"cavity\ndistribution,\" which is the approximate model for the prior and all other parts\nof the data. EP iteratively approximates the moments of the tilted\ndistributions and incorporates those approximations into a global posterior\napproximation. As such, EP can be used to divide the computation for large\nmodels into manageable sizes. The computation for each partition can be made\nparallel with occasional exchanging of information between processes through\nthe global posterior approximation. Moments of multivariate tilted\ndistributions can be approximated in various ways, including, MCMC, Laplace\napproximations, and importance sampling.", "authors": ["Andrew Gelman", "Aki Vehtari", "Pasi Jyl√§nki", "Christian Robert", "Nicolas Chopin", "John P.
