Distributed implementations run under Hadoop on facility computing clouds. The probabilistic model under study is the infinite HMM, in which parameters are learnt using an instance blocked Gibbs sampling, with a step consisting of a dynamic program. We apply this model to learn part-of-speech tags from newswire text in an unsupervised fashion. However our focus here is on runtime performance, as opposed to NLP-relevant scores, embodied by iteration duration, ease of development, deployment and debugging.", "authors": ["Sébastien Bratières", "Jurgen van Gael", "Andreas Vlachos", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "citations": [227716500, 234019992, 279633530], "id": 224175402}
