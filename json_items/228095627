We used our algorithm to analyze a corpus of 1.2 million books (33\nbillion words) with thousands of topics. Our approach reduces the bias of\nvariational inference and generalizes to many Bayesian hidden-variable models.", "authors": ["David Mimno", "Matt Hoffman", "David Blei"], "citations": [279309917, 268451692, 236687792, 232063267, 268435721, 268009492, 220874072, 230786935, 256327429, 259125814], "id": 228095627}
