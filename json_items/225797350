We propose a nonparametric Bayesian model for histogram clustering which automatically determines the number of segments\nwhen spatial smoothness constraints on the class assignments are enforced by a Markov Random Field. A Dirichlet process prior\ncontrols the level of resolution which corresponds to the number of clusters in data with a unique cluster structure. The resulting posterior is efficiently\nsampled by a variant of a conjugate-case sampling algorithm for Dirichlet process mixture models. Experimental results are\nprovided for real-world gray value images, synthetic aperture radar images and magnetic resonance imaging data.", "authors": ["Peter Orbanz", "Joachim M.
