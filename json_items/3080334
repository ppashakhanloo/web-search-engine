IEEE Trans Inf Theory", "abstract": "Algorithms that must deal with complicated global functions of\nmany variables often exploit the manner in which the given functions\nfactor as a product of “local” functions, each of which\ndepends on a subset of the variables. Such a factorization can be\nvisualized with a bipartite graph that we call a factor graph, In this\ntutorial paper, we present a generic message-passing algorithm, the\nsum-product algorithm, that operates in a factor graph. Following a\nsingle, simple computational rule, the sum-product algorithm\ncomputes-either exactly or approximately-various marginal functions\nderived from the global function. A wide variety of algorithms developed\nin artificial intelligence, signal processing, and digital\ncommunications can be derived as specific instances of the sum-product\nalgorithm, including the forward/backward algorithm, the Viterbi\nalgorithm, the iterative “turbo” decoding algorithm, Pearl's\n(1988) belief propagation algorithm for Bayesian networks, the Kalman\nfilter, and certain fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithms", "authors": ["Frank R.
