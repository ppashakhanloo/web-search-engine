One new approach is to make Metropolis-Hastings\nupdates of the indicators specifying which mixture component is associated\nwith each observation, perhaps supplemented with a partial form of\nGibbs sampling. The other new approach extends Gibbs sampling for\nthese indicators by using a set of auxiliary parameters. These methods\nare simple to implement and are more efficient than previous ways\nof handling general Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate\npriors.", "authors": ["Radford M.
