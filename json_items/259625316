In\nthis note we offer details on how to efficiently implement this algorithm in\npractice. We also suggest default choices for the form of the posterior\napproximation, the number of iterations, the step size, and other user choices.\nBy using these defaults it becomes possible to construct good posterior\napproximations for hierarchical models completely automatically.", "authors": ["Tim Salimans"], "citations": [], "id": 259625316}
