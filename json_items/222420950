The inherent structure can be motivated by resorting to hierarchical models of either parametric or nonparametric nature. Parametric examples include the product partition models (PPMs) and the model-based approach of Dasgupta and Raftery (J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 93 (1998) 294), while nonparametric alternatives include the Dirichlet process, and more generally, the species sampling models (SSMs). Under exchangeability, PPMs and SSMs induce the same type of partition structure. The methods are discussed in the context of outlier detection in normal linear regression models and of (univariate) density estimation.", "authors": ["Fernando A.
