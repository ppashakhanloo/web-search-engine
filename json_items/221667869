EDHMMs are HMMs that have\nlatent states consisting of both discrete state-indicator and discrete\nstate-duration random variables. In contrast to the implicit geometric state\nduration distribution possessed by the standard HMM, EDHMMs allow the direct\nparameterisation and estimation of per-state duration distributions. As most\nduration distributions are defined over the positive integers, truncation or\nother approximations are usually required to perform EDHMM inference.", "authors": ["Michael Dewar", "Chris Wiggins", "Frank Wood"], "citations": [263582646, 265545123, 267034770, 257665466, 283439283, 275050127, 282710442, 289991467], "id": 221667869}
