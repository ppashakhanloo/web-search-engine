This paper presents a model, which integrates visual topics and regional contexts to automatic image annotation. Regional contexts model the relationship between the regions, while visual topics provide the global distribution of topics over an image. Previous image annotation methods neglected the relationship between the regions in an image, while these regions are exactly explanation of the image semantics, therefore considering the relationship between them are helpful to annotate the images. Regional contexts and visual topics are learned by PLSA (Probability Latent Semantic Analysis) from the training data. The proposed model incorporates these two types of information by MCDM (Multi Criteria Decision Making) approach based on WSM (Weighted Sum Method). Experiments conducted on the 5k Corel dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.", "authors": ["Hengame Deljooi", "Somayye Jafarali Jassbi"], "citations": [], "id": 275347841}
