Compared to recently developed parametric\nmethods, the proposed frameworks feature accurate function approximation and\nefficient on-line operations. Theoretically, we derive the mathematical\nconnection of KL control based on dynamic programming with earlier work in\ncontrol theory which relies on information theoretic dualities for case of\ninfinite time horizon problems. Algorithmically, we give analytical expressions\nto optimal control policies in nonparametric forms, and propose on-line update\nschemes with budgeted computational costs. Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and usefulness of the proposed frameworks.", "authors": ["Yunpeng Pan", "Evangelos Theodorou"], "citations": [], "id": 261700410}
