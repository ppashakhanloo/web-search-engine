However, this assumption does not hold in many real-world scenarios. For example, in facial expression recognition, the appearance of an expression may vary significantly for different people. As a result, previous work has shown that learning from adequate person-specific data can improve the expression recognition performance over the one from generic data. However, person-specific data is typically very sparse in real-world applications due to the difficulties of data collection and labeling, and learning from sparse data may suffer from serious over-fitting. In this paper, we propose to learn a person-specific model through transfer learning. By transferring the informative knowledge from other people, it allows us to learn an accurate model for a new subject with only a small amount of person-specific data. We conduct extensive experiments to compare different person-specific models for facial expression and action unit (AU) recognition, and show that transfer learning significantly improves the recognition performance with a small amount of training data.
