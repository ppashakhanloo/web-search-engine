Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, autoencoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation, and manifold learning.", "authors": ["Yoshua Bengio", "Aaron Courville", "Pascal Vincent"], "citations": [283716595, 290445292, 291186593, 290445419, 287250079, 284219015, 284219526, 284219762, 284243746, 283038724], "id": 240308775}
