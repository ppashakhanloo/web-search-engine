The algorithm is inspired by the classical splitting method and can be applied to\ngeneral static simulation models. We provide examples from rare-event probability estimation, counting, and sampling, demonstrating\nthat the proposed method can outperform existing Markov chain sampling methods in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.", "authors": ["Zdravko I.
