The\nmethod has been widely used for unsupervised learning tasks, including\nrecommender systems (rating matrix of users by items) and document clustering\n(weighting matrix of papers by keywords). However, traditional NMF methods\ntypically assume the number of latent factors (i.e., dimensionality of the\nloading matrices) to be fixed. This assumption makes them inflexible for many\napplications. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric NMF framework to\nmitigate this issue by using dependent Indian Buffet Processes (dIBP). In a\nnutshell, we apply a correlation function for the generation of two stick\nweights associated with each pair of columns of loading matrices, while still\nmaintaining their respective marginal distribution specified by IBP. As a\nconsequence, the generation of two loading matrices will be column-wise\n(indirectly) correlated. Under this same framework, two classes of correlation\nfunction are proposed (1) using Bivariate beta distribution and (2) using\nCopula function. Both methods allow us to adopt our work for various\napplications by flexibly choosing an appropriate parameter settings. Compared\nwith the other state-of-the art approaches in this area, such as using Gaussian\nProcess (GP)-based dIBP, our work is seen to be much more flexible in terms of\nallowing the two corresponding binary matrix columns to have greater variations\nin their non-zero entries. Our experiments on the real-world and synthetic\ndatasets show that three proposed models perform well on the document\nclustering task comparing standard NMF without predefining the dimension for\nthe factor matrices, and the Bivariate beta distribution-based and Copula-based\nmodels have better flexibility than the GP-based model.", "authors": ["Junyu Xuan", "Jie Lu", "Guangquan Zhang", "Richard Yi Da Xu", "Xiangfeng Luo"], "citations": [], "id": 280062180}
