In this brief, we present the infinite HCRF (iHCRF), which is a nonparametric model based on hierarchical Dirichlet processes and is capable of automatically learning the optimal number of hidden states for a classification task. We show how we learn the model hyperparameters with an effective Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling technique, and we explain the process that underlines our iHCRF model with the Restaurant Franchise Rating Agencies analogy. We show that the iHCRF is able to converge to a correct number of represented hidden states, and outperforms the best finite HCRFs-chosen via cross-validation-for the difficult tasks of recognizing instances of agreement, disagreement, and pain. Moreover, the iHCRF manages to achieve this performance in significantly less total training, validation, and testing time.", "authors": ["Konstantinos Bousmalis", "Stefanos Zafeiriou", "Louis-Philippe Morency", "Maja Pantic"], "citations": [283663670, 280908562, 260732752, 237082421, 263965917, 262330359, 287882482, 287883985, 262149085, 264120989], "id": 260353896}
