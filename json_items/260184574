The so-called Friend Wall system solves two problems: (1) How to effectively classify the local images with respect to related social characters and events. (2) How to efficiently generate layout to compactly arrange many photos onto a single canvas. For the first problem, we propose a novel image annotation scheme by employing both of the image visual features and Metadata. Motivated by the observation that SNS (Social Networking Service) images, especially those come from the userâ€™s acquaintances always contain rich information, we apply these images as our training set and explore their social attributes. In our definition, social attributes contain a set of intrinsic labels such as Who, When, Where, and What. To effectively arrange the photos on a single canvas, we proposed a binary tree based representation and fast algorithm for layout generation. Experiments show the examples of Friend Wall. The effectiveness of social attribute annotation is proved as well.", "authors": ["Zhipeng Wu", "Kiyoharu Aizawa"], "citations": [269455490, 277603295], "id": 260184574}
