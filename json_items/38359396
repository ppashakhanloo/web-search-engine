It is based on a conjugate class of a priori distributions on the parameter space of semi-Markov transition distributions. The class is characterized by a Dirichlet family of distributions for random Markov matrices and a Beta family of Levy processes for random cumulative hazard functions. The main result is the derivation of the posterior law from an observation of the Markov renewal process over a period of time.", "authors": ["Michael J.
