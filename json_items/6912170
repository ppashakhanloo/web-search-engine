Gradient descent can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such \"autoencoder\" networks, but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality of data.", "authors": ["G.E.
