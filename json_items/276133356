Recently, social signal processing (SSP) has proposed to apply similar methods to human–human interactions with the\nhope of better understanding and modeling social interactions. Most of the social signals employed are facial expressions,\nbody movements and speech, but studies using physiological signals remain scarce. In this paper, we motivate the use of physiological\nsignals in the context of social interactions. Specifically, we review studies which have investigated the relationship between\nvarious physiological indices and social interactions. We then propose two main directions to apply physiological SSP: using\nphysiological signals of individual users as new social cues displayed in the group and using inter-user physiology to measure\nproperties of the interactions such as conflict and social presence. We conclude that physiological measures have the potential\nto enhance social interactions and to connect people.", "authors": ["Guillaume Chanel", "C.
