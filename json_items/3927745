After isolating the face, eyes, eyebrows\nand mouth in a portrait photograph, we represent a face abstractly as an\n8-element vector of ratios between these features. We use a variant of\nthe K-nearest neighbor algorithm, in the context of a parameterized\nmetric space optimized using a genetic algorithm, to learn a beauty\nassignment function from a training set of photographs rated by humans.\nWe assess performance on a test set of photographs, concluding that when\nfacial ratios are accurately extracted in the computer vision phase, the\nresults of the program are highly correlated with median-human ratings\nof beauty", "authors": ["Parham Aarabi", "Dominic Hughes", "Keyvan Mohajer", "Majid Emami"], "citations": [265726717, 259442100, 233970262, 221472863, 221292192, 224281277, 252064007, 228342727, 221296943, 252513124], "id": 3927745}
