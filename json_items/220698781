Several recent papers demonstrate joint inference between the segmentation\nof entity mentions and their de-duplication, however, they have various weaknesses: inference information flows only in one\ndirection, the number of uncertain hypotheses is severely limited, or the subtasks are only loosely coupled. This paper presents\na highly-coupled, bi-directional approach to joint inference based on efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling in a relational\nconditional random field. The model is specified with our new probabilistic programming language that leverages imperative\nconstructs to define factor graph structure and operation. Experimental results show that our approach provides a dramatic\nreduction in error while also running faster than the previous state-of-the-art system.", "authors": ["Sameer Singh", "Karl Schultz", "Andrew McCallum"], "citations": [241770632, 51928468, 221654670, 221102929, 221618661, 220817183, 221012836, 220698997, 241182250, 220269794], "id": 220698781}
