We give\nverifiable criteria on the prior for posterior consistency when observations\nform a time series, and prove that any non-trivial prior is inconsistent when\nall observations are contemporaneous. We then show that the likelihood given a\ndata set of size $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ is constant across $\\Lambda$-measures whose\nleading $n - 2$ moments agree, and focus on inferring truncated sequences of\nmoments. We provide a large class of functionals which can be extremised using\nfinite computation given a credibility region of posterior truncated moment\nsequences, and a pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for sampling the\nposterior. Finally, we compare the efficiency of the exact and noisy\npseudo-marginal algorithms with and without delayed acceptance acceleration\nusing a simulation study.", "authors": ["Jere Koskela", "Paul A.
