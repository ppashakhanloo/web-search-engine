We first\nintroduce the canonical formulation of the large-scale optimization problem.\nNext, we describe the general form of ADMM and then focus on several direct\nextensions and sophisticated modifications of ADMM from $2$-block to $N$-block\nsettings to deal with the optimization problem. The iterative schemes and\nconvergence properties of each extension/modification are given, and the\nimplementation on large-scale computing facilities is also illustrated.\nFinally, we numerate several applications in communication networks, such as\nthe security constrained optimal power flow problem in smart grid networks and\nmobile data offloading problem in software defined networks (SDNs).", "authors": ["Lanchao Liu", "Zhu Han"], "citations": [], "id": 274730183}
