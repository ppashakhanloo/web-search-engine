Along with the constant flow of data, it is critical to\nclassify and segment the observations on-the-fly, without being limited to a\nrigid number of classes. In addition, the model needs to be capable of updating\nits parameters to comply with possible evolutions. This interesting problem,\nhowever, is not adequately addressed in the literature since many studies focus\non offline classification over a pre-defined class set. In this paper, we\npropose a principled solution to this gap by introducing an adaptive online\nsystem based on Markov switching models with hierarchical Dirichlet process\npriors. This infinite adaptive online approach is capable of segmenting and\nclassifying the sequential data over unlimited number of classes, while meeting\nthe memory and delay constraints of streaming contexts. The model is further\nenhanced by introducing a learning rate, responsible for balancing the extent\nto which the model sustains its previous learning (parameters) or adapts to the\nnew streaming observations. Experimental results on several variants of\nstationary and evolving synthetic data and two video datasets, TUM Assistive\nKitchen and collatedWeizmann, show remarkable performance in segmentation and\nclassification, particularly for evolutionary sequences with changing\ndistributions and/or containing new, unseen classes.", "authors": ["Ava Bargi", "Richard Yi Da Xu", "Massimo Piccardi"], "citations": [], "id": 273472293}
