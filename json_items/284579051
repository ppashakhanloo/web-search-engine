Like\nrectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parameterized ReLUs\n(PReLUs), ELUs also avoid a vanishing gradient via the identity for positive\nvalues. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the\nunits with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative\nvalues which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero. Zero\nmeans speed up learning because they bring the gradient closer to the unit\nnatural gradient. We show that the unit natural gradient differs from the\nnormal gradient by a bias shift term, which is proportional to the mean\nactivation of incoming units. Like batch normalization, ELUs push the mean\ntowards zero, but with a significantly smaller computational footprint. While\nother activation functions like LReLUs and PReLUs also have negative values,\nthey do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a\nnegative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the propagated\nvariation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of\nparticular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the\ndegree of their absence. Consequently, dependencies between ELUs are much\neasier to model and distinct concepts are less likely to interfere. We found\nthat ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to better generalization\nperformance once networks have many layers (>= 5). Using ELUs, we obtained the\nbest published single-crop result on CIFAR-100 and CIFAR-10. On ImageNet, ELU\nnetworks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with similar\nclassification performance, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a\nsingle crop, single model network.", "authors": ["Djork-Arn√© Clevert", "Thomas Unterthiner", "Sepp Hochreiter"], "citations": [], "id": 284579051}
