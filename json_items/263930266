In this paper, we introduce a novel spectral\nalgorithm to perform inference in HSMMs. Unlike expectation maximization (EM),\nour approach correctly estimates the probability of given observation sequence\nbased on a set of training sequences. Our approach is based on estimating\ncertain sample moments, whose order depends only logarithmically on the maximum\nlength of the hidden state persistence. Moreover, the algorithm requires only a\nfew spectral decompositions and is therefore computationally efficient.\nEmpirical evaluations on synthetic and real data demonstrate the promise of the\nalgorithm.", "authors": ["Igor Melnyk", "Arindam Banerjee"], "citations": [], "id": 263930266}
