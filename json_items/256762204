Given its significance, there has been a large body\nof literature among which many are not statistically based. In this paper, we\npropose a novel stochastic blockmodel based on a logistic regression setup with\nnode correction terms to better address this problem. We follow a Bayesian\napproach that explicitly captures the community behavior via prior\nspecification. We then adopt a data augmentation strategy with latent\nPolya-Gamma variables to obtain posterior samples. We conduct inference based\non a canonically mapped centroid estimator that formally addresses label\nnon-identifiability. We demonstrate the novel proposed model and estimation on\nreal-world as well as simulated benchmark networks and show that the proposed\nmodel and estimator are more flexible, representative, and yield smaller error\nrates when compared to the MAP estimator from classical degree-corrected\nstochastic blockmodels.", "authors": ["Lijun Peng", "Luis Carvalho"], "citations": [], "id": 256762204}
