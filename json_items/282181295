The multi-layered model is designed by constructing a\nhierarchy of temporal sigmoid belief networks (TSBNs), defined as a sequential\nstack of sigmoid belief networks (SBNs). Each SBN has a contextual hidden\nstate, inherited from the previous SBNs in the sequence, and is used to\nregulate its hidden bias. Scalable learning and inference algorithms are\nderived by introducing a recognition model that yields fast sampling from the\nvariational posterior. This recognition model is trained jointly with the\ngenerative model, by maximizing its variational lower bound on the\nlog-likelihood. Experimental results on bouncing balls, polyphonic music,\nmotion capture, and text streams show that the proposed approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art predictive performance, and has the capacity to synthesize\nvarious sequences.", "authors": ["Zhe Gan", "Chunyuan Li", "Ricardo Henao", "David Carlson", "Lawrence Carin"], "citations": [284579582, 285779762, 284476535, 288059869, 288059688], "id": 282181295}
