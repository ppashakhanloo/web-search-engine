The resulting so-called\npseudo-marginal algorithm allows us to substitute an unbiased Monte Carlo\nestimator of the likelihood for the true likelihood which might be intractable\nor too expensive to compute. Under regularity conditions, it has been\nestablished that an efficient implementation of this algorithm requires the\nvariance of the estimator of the log-likelihood ratio appearing in the\nacceptance probability of the pseudo-marginal algorithm to be of order 1 for\n$T$ data points as $T\\rightarrow\\infty$, which in turn typically requires\nscaling the number $N$ of Monte Carlo samples linearly with $T$. We propose a\nsimple and widely applicable modification of the pseudo-marginal algorithm,\ntermed the correlated pseudo-marginal algorithm, which relies on an estimator\nof the log-likelihood ratio whose variance is shown to be of order $1$ as\n$N,T\\rightarrow\\infty$ whenever $N/T\\rightarrow0$. Experimentally, the\nefficiency of computations is increased relative to the standard\npseudo-marginal algorithm by up to 180-fold in our simulations.", "authors": ["George Deligiannidis", "Arnaud Doucet", "Michael K.
