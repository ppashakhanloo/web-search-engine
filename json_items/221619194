Unlike bi-clustering models, which assign each row or column to a single cluster based on a categorical hidden feature, our binary fe ature model reflects the prior belief that items and attributes can be associated wit h more than one latent cluster at a time. We provide simple learning and inference r ules for this new model,and show how,to extend it to an infinite model,in which,the number,of features is not a priori fixed but is allowed to grow with the si ze of the data. 1 Distributed representations for dyadic data", "authors": ["Edward Meeds", "Zoubin Ghahramani", "Radford M.
