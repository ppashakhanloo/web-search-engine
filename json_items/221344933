We demonstrate some limitations of the original HDP-HMM formulation (Teh et al., 2006), and propose a sticky exten- sion which allows more robust learning of smoothly varying dynamics. Using DP mix- tures, this formulation also allows learning of more complex, multimodal emission dis- tributions. We further develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approx- imation of the DP to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Via extensive experiments with syn- thetic data and the NIST speaker diarization database, we demonstrate the advantages of our sticky extension, and the utility of the HDP-HMM in real-world applications.", "authors": ["Emily B.
