The performance parameter $y$ is random due to the presence of various\nsources of uncertainty in the system, and our goal is to estimate the\nprobability density function (PDF) of $y$. We propose to use the multicanonical\nMonte Carlo (MMC) method, a special type of adaptive importance sampling\nalgorithm, to compute the PDF of interest. Moreover, we develop an adaptive\nalgorithm to construct local Gaussian process surrogates to further accelerate\nthe MMC iterations. With numerical examples we demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod can achieve several orders of magnitudes of speedup over the standard\nMonte Carlo method.", "authors": ["Keyi Wu", "Jinglai Li"], "citations": [], "id": 281312187}
