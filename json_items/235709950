{"references": [], "title": "A Sequential Procedure for Selecting the Population with the Largest Mean from $k$ Normal Populations", "abstract": "In this paper sequential procedures are given for selecting the normal population with the greatest mean when (a) the $k$ populations have a common known variance or (b) the $k$ populations have a common but unknown variance, so that in each case the probability of making the correct selection exceeds a specified value when the greatest mean exceeds all other means by at least a specified amount. The procedures in the present paper all have the property that inferior populations can be eliminated from further consideration as the experiment proceeds.", "authors": ["Edward Paulson"], "citations": [279633530, 259478458, 265830785, 257196296, 257199330, 227936002, 220258688, 4249986, 221528942, 4213819], "id": 235709950}
