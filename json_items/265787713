This method was proposed by Adams,\nMurray and MacKay (ICML, 2009), who developed a tractable computational\napproach and showed in simulation and real data experiments that it can work\nquite satisfactorily. The results presented in the present paper provide\ntheoretical underpinning of the method. In particular, we show how to tune the\npriors on the hyper parameters of the model in order for the procedure to\nautomatically adapt to the degree of smoothness of the unknown intensity and to\nachieve optimal convergence rates.", "authors": ["Alisa Kirichenko", "Harry van Zanten"], "citations": [], "id": 265787713}
