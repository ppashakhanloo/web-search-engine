They can often be described by some smooth functions or curves. A joint analysis of all the repeated measurements of the dynamic traits by functional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods has the benefits to (1) understand the genetic control of the whole dynamic process of the quantitative traits, and (2) improve the statistical power to detect QTLs. One crucial issue in functional QTL mapping is how to correctly describe the smoothness of trajectories of functional valued traits. We develop an efficient Bayesian non-parametric multiple-loci procedure for mapping dynamic traits. The method uses the Bayesian P-splines with (non-parametric) B-spline bases to specify the functional form of a QTL trajectory, and a random walk prior to automatically determine its degree of smoothness. An efficient deterministic variational Bayes algorithm is used to implement both (1) search an optimal subset of QTLs among large marker panels, and (2) estimate the genetic effects of the selected QTLs changing over time. Our method can be fast even on some large scale data sets. The advantages of our method are illustrated on both simulated and real data sets.", "authors": ["Zitong Li", "Mikko J Sillanpää"], "citations": [266743878, 269188036, 276074571, 283718881, 283485849, 280123855, 283049538, 283501878], "id": 239073675}
