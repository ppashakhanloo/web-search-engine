We show that under appropriate regularity conditions, the\nmean-field value of the stochastic differential game with exponentiated\nintegral cost functional coincides with the value function described by a\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with an additional quadratic term. We\nprovide an explicit solution of the mean-field best response when the\ninstantaneous cost functions are log-quadratic and the state dynamics are\naffine in the control. An equivalent mean-field risk-neutral problem is\nformulated and the corresponding mean-field equilibria are characterized in\nterms of backward-forward macroscopic McKean-Vlasov equations,\nFokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations, and HJB equations. We provide numerical\nexamples on the mean field behavior to illustrate both linear and McKean-Vlasov\ndynamics.", "authors": ["Hamidou Tembine", "Quanyan Zhu", "Tamer Basar"], "citations": [268747171, 284476296, 261286990, 276257676, 268747178, 267454368, 261322647, 228523675, 257800569, 261767092], "id": 232143618}
