Blobworld is a system for image retrieval based on finding coherent image regions which roughly correspond to objects. The image is segmented into regions by fitting a mixture of Gaussians to the pixel distribution in a joint color-texture-position feature space. Each region (\"blob\") is then associated with color and texture descriptors. Querying is based on the user specifying attributes of one or two regions of interest, rather than a description of the entire image. In order to make largescale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions using a tree. Because indexing in the high-dimensional feature space is computationally prohibitive, we use a lower-rank approximation to the high-dimensional distance. Experiments show encouraging results for both querying and indexing. 1 Introduction From a user's point of view, an information retrieval system can be measured by the quality and speed with which it answers the user's information need.
