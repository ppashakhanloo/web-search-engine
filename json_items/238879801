In practice, it is often difficult to decide which parametric distribution is suitable to characterize a cluster, especially for multivariate data. Moreover, the densities of individual clusters may be multimodal themselves, and therefore cannot be accurately modeled by basic parametric distributions. This article explores a clustering approach that models each cluster by a mixture of normals. The resulting overall model is a multilayer mixture of normals. Algorithms to estimate the model and perform clustering are developed based on the classification maximum likelihood (CML) and mixture maximum likelihood (MML) criteria. BIC and ICL-BIC are examined for choosing the number of normal components per cluster. Experiments on both simulated and real data are presented.", "authors": ["Jia Li"], "citations": [268525648, 227859789, 254951479, 41693678, 226330159, 229901217, 222689463, 4993351, 5596267, 227155286], "id": 238879801}
