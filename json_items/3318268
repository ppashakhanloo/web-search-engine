As a preprocessing step, we propose to identify a\nhop-free subset of data by discarding high-entropy spectral slices from\nthe spectrogram. High-resolution localization is then achieved via\neither quadrilinear regression of four-way data generated by\ncapitalizing on both spatial and temporal shift invariance or a new\nmaximum likelihood (ML)-based two-dimensional (2-D) harmonic retrieval\nalgorithm. The latter option achieves the best-known model\nidentifiability bound while remaining close to the Cramer-Rao bound even\nat low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Following beamforming using the\nrecovered directions, a dynamic programming approach is developed for\njoint ML estimation of signal frequencies and hop instants in\nsingle-user tracking. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is\nillustrated in pertinent simulations", "authors": ["Xiangqian Liu", "Nicholas D.
