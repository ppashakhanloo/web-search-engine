Existing approaches\nto measuring the uncertainty of decision forest predictions are known to\nperform poorly, and so Gaussian processes and approximate variants are the\nstandard tools in these application areas. With a goal of providing efficient\nstate-of-the-art predictions together with estimates of uncertainty, we\ndescribe a regression framework using Mondrian forests, an approach to decision\nforests where the underlying random decision trees are modeled as i.i.d.\nMondrian processes and efficient algorithms perform nonparametric Bayesian\ninference within each tree and ordinary model combination across trees. In our\nframework, the underlying nonparametric inference is a Gaussian diffusion over\nthe tree, which results in a multivariate Gaussian calculation for inference in\nlight of finite data that can be carried out efficiently using belief\npropagation. On a synthetic task designed to mimic a typical probabilistic\nnumerical task, we demonstrate that Mondrian forest regression delivers far\nsuperior uncertainty quantification than existing decision forest methods with\nlittle-to-no cost in predictive performance. We then turn to a real-world\nprobabilistic numerics benchmark modeling flight delay, where we compare\nMondrian forests also to large-scale GP approximate methods. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that Mondrian forests can deliver superior uncertainty assessments\nto GPs, as measured by negative predictive log density, with little-to-no loss\nin RMSE performance.", "authors": ["Balaji Lakshminarayanan", "Daniel M.
