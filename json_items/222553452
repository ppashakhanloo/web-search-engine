We prove that, under certain conditions, LSI does succeed in capturing the underlying semantics of the corpus and achieves improved retrieval performance. We propose the technique of random projection as a way of speeding up LSI. We complement our theorems with encouraging experimental results. We also argue that our results may be viewed in a more general framework, as a theoretical basis for the use of spectral methods in a wider class of applications such as collaborative filtering.", "authors": ["Christos H.
