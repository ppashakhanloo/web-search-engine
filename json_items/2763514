The specification of mixture posterior distributions means that the presence of k! modes is known immediately. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques usually have difficulties with well-separated modes such as occur here; the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler stays within a neighbourhood of a local mode and fails to visit other equally important modes. We show that exploration of these modes can be imposed on the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler using tempered transitions based on Langevin algorithms. However, as the prior distribution does not distinguish between the different components, the posterior mixture distribution is symmetric and thus standard estimators such as posterior means cannot be used. Since this is also true for most non-symmetric priors, we propose alternatives for Bayesian inference for permutation invariant posteriors, including a cluster...", "authors": ["Gilles Celeux", "Merrilee Hurn", "Christian P.
