Additionally, we extend the Bayesian Fuzzy Clustering model to handle a variable number of clusters and present a particle filter inference technique to estimate the model parameters including the number of clusters. We show results on synthetic and real data and compare with other approaches.", "authors": ["Taylor C. Glenn", "Alina Zare", "Paul D. Gader"], "citations": [], "id": 282603739}
