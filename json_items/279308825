The auto- and cross-pair correlation functions of the process can be obtained in closed analytical forms and approximate simulation of the process is straightforward. We use the proposed process to model interactions within and among five tree species in the Barro Colorado Island plot.\n© 2015, The International Biometric Society.", "authors": ["Abdollah Jalilian", "Yongtao Guan", "Jorge Mateu", "Rasmus Waagepetersen"], "citations": [], "id": 279308825}
