Recent advances in stochastic\nvariational inference algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) have\nmade it feasible to learn topic models on large-scale corpora, but these\nmethods do not currently take full advantage of the collapsed representation of\nthe model. We propose a stochastic algorithm for collapsed variational Bayesian\ninference for LDA, which is simpler and more efficient than the state of the\nart method. We show connections between collapsed variational Bayesian\ninference and MAP estimation for LDA, and leverage these connections to prove\nconvergence properties of the proposed algorithm. In experiments on large-scale\ntext corpora, the algorithm was found to converge faster and often to a better\nsolution than the previous method. Human-subject experiments also demonstrated\nthat the method can learn coherent topics in seconds on small corpora,\nfacilitating the use of topic models in interactive document analysis software.", "authors": ["James Foulds", "Levi Boyles", "Christopher Dubois", "Padhraic Smyth", "Max Welling"], "citations": [283478023, 265787924, 260289417, 259044742, 262452147, 283966077, 279180781, 280221142, 280498229], "id": 236687792}
