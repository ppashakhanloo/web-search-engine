Two sampling schemes are discussed in connection with the problem of determining optimum selection probabilities according to the information available in a supplementary variable. Admittedly, these two schemes have limited application. They should prove useful, however, for the first stage of sampling with multi-stage designs, since both permit unbiased estimation of the sampling variance without resorting to additional assumptions.* Journal Paper No. J2139 of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, Ames, Iowa, Project 1005.
