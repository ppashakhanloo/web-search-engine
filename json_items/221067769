The specific tasks studied are paddle juggling,\nball-in-a-wedge juggling, five ball juggling, and devil sticking. All\ndynamic tasks introduced are solved by special purpose systems. The\nresults of these investigations may provide insight into how open loop\ncontrol can serve as a useful foundation for closed loop control and,\nparticularly, what to focus on in learning control", "authors": ["Stefan Schaal", "Christopher G.
