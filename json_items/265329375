The procedure is based on the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier [15], and it also uses the idea of self-consistency due to Efron [8]. Under fairly general assumptions, the method is shown to yield unique consistent maximum likelihood estimators. Asymptotic expressions for their variances and covariances are derived and an extension to the case of arbitrary censoring is suggested.", "authors": ["Bruce W.
