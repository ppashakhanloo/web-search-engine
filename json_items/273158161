This algorithm\ndivides the problem of estimating the stochastic gradients over multiple\nvariational parameters into smaller sub-tasks so that each sub-task exploits\nintelligently the information coming from the most relevant part of the\nvariational distribution. This is achieved by performing an exact expectation\nover the single random variable that mostly correlates with the variational\nparameter of interest resulting in a Rao-Blackwellized estimate that has low\nvariance and can work efficiently for both continuous and discrete random\nvariables. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has interesting similarities\nwith Gibbs sampling but at the same time, unlike Gibbs sampling, it can be\ntrivially parallelized.", "authors": ["Michalis K.
