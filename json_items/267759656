{"references": [], "title": "Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Modulated Poisson Processes", "abstract": "We present the first fully variational Bayesian inference scheme for\ncontinuous Gaussian-process-modulated Poisson processes. Such point processes\nare used in a variety of domains, including neuroscience, geo-statistics and\nastronomy, but their use is hindered by the computational cost of existing\ninference schemes. Our scheme: requires no discretisation of the domain; scales\nlinearly in the number of observed events; and is many orders of magnitude\nfaster than previous sampling based approaches. The resulting algorithm is\nshown to outperform standard methods on synthetic examples, coal mining\ndisaster data and in the prediction of Malaria incidences in Kenya.", "authors": ["Chris Lloyd", "Tom Gunter", "Michael A.
