To solve this semi-blind deconvolution\nproblem, prior distributions are specified for the PSF and the 3D image.\nJoint image reconstruction and PSF estimation is then performed within a\nBayesian framework, using a variational algorithm to estimate the\nposterior distribution. The image prior distribution imposes an explicit\natomic measure that corresponds to image sparsity. Importantly, the\nproposed Bayesian deconvolution algorithm does not require hand tuning.\nSimulation results clearly demonstrate that the semi-blind deconvolution\nalgorithm compares favorably with previous Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC) version of myopic sparse reconstruction. It significantly\noutperforms mismatched non-blind algorithms that rely on the assumption\nof the perfect knowledge of the PSF. The algorithm is illustrated on\nreal data from magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM).", "authors": ["Se Un Park", "Nicolas Dobigeon", "Alfred O. Hero"], "citations": [], "id": 258817506}
