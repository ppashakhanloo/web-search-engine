Bayesian nonparametric variants of these models, which use the\nIndian buffet process (IBP) as a prior over latent features, allow the number\nof features to be determined from the data. We present a generalization of the\nIBP, the distance dependent Indian buffet process (dd-IBP), for modeling\nnon-exchangeable data. It relies on distances defined between data points,\nbiasing nearby data to share more features. The choice of distance measure\nallows for many kinds of dependencies, including temporal and spatial. Further,\nthe original IBP is a special case of the dd-IBP. In this paper, we develop the\ndd-IBP and theoretically characterize its feature-sharing properties. We derive\na Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for a linear Gaussian model with a dd-IBP\nprior and study its performance on several non-exchangeable data sets.", "authors": ["Samuel J.
