We study both on-line and off-line learning in the following unsupervised learning scheme: p patterns are sampled independently from a distribution on the N-sphere with a single symmetry breaking orientation. Exact results are obtained in the limit p !1 and N !1 with finite ratio p=N . One finds that for smooth pattern distributions, the asymptotic behavior of the optimal off-line and on-line learning are identical, and saturate the Cramer-Rao inequality from statistics. For discontinuous pattern distributions on the other hand, the optimal online algorithm needs (at least) twice as many examples asymptotically to reach the optimal off-line performance. 1 Introduction Over the last decade, networks that can learn by examples have been investigated theoretically by applying a formalism similar to that of statistical mechanics [1]-[8]. Typically, the network is trained off-line by minimization of a cost function which incorporates the information about the whole training set...", "authors": ["C.
