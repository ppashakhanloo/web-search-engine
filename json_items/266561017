The fact that many signals, though high dimensional, are\nintrinsically low dimensional has given the possibility to recover them stably\nfrom a relatively small number of their measurements. For example, in\ncompressed sensing with the standard (synthesis) sparsity prior and in matrix\ncompletion, the number of measurements needed is proportional (up to a\nlogarithmic factor) to the signal's manifold dimension.\nRecently, a new natural low-dimensional signal model has been proposed: the\ncosparse analysis prior. In the noiseless case, it is possible to recover\nsignals from this model, using a combinatorial search, from a number of\nmeasurements proportional to the signal's manifold dimension. However, if we\nask for stability to noise or an efficient (polynomial complexity) solver, all\nthe existing results demand a number of measurements which is far removed from\nthe manifold dimension, sometimes far greater. Thus, it is natural to ask\nwhether this gap is a deficiency of the theory and the solvers, or if there\nexists a real barrier in recovering the cosparse signals by relying only on\ntheir manifold dimension. In this work we show that the latter is true both in\ntheory and in simulations. This gives a practical counter-example to the\ngrowing literature on compressed acquisition of signals based on manifold\ndimension.", "authors": ["Raja Giryes", "Yaniv Plan", "Roman Vershynin"], "citations": [267395783, 272359217], "id": 266561017}
