{"id": 283986483, "abstract": "Visuo-spatial attention and gaze control depend on the interaction of foveal\nand peripheral processing. The foveal and peripheral compartments of the visual\nfield are differentially sensitive to parts of the spatial frequency spectrum.\nIn two experiments, we investigated how the selective attenuation of spatial\nfrequencies in the central or the peripheral affects eye-movement behavior\nduring real-world scene viewing. Gaze-contingent low-pass or high-pass filters\nwith varying filter cutoffs (Experiment 1) or filter size (Experiment 2) were\napplied. Compared with unfiltered control conditions, mean fixation durations\nincreased more with central high-pass and peripheral low-pass filtering than\nwith central low-pass and peripheral high-pass filtering. Increasing filter\nsize and filter level progressively increased fixation durations in half of the\nconditions, but had no effect with the other conditions. The effects suggest\nthat fixation durations prolong with increasing processing difficulty as long\nas the available information is useful. When fixation durations were unaffected\nby increasing processing difficulty, saccade amplitudes were modulated instead,\nindicating a trade-off between saccade timing and saccadic selection. Taken\ntogether, interactions of perception and gaze control are compatible with a\nperceptual economy account.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [], "references": [222399790, 21410564, 279236477, 200806059, 14041746, 8101388, 10919126, 16682997, 10821936, 7147418], "authors": ["Anke Cajar", "Jochen Laubrock", "Ralf Engbert"], "title": "Spatial frequency processing in the central and peripheral visual field: Effects of gaze-contingent filter strength and size"}
