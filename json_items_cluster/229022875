{"id": 229022875, "abstract": "A dynamical extension that makes possible the integration of a kinematic controller and a torque controller for nonholonomic mobile robots is presented. A combined kinematic/torque control law is developed using backstepping, and asymptotic stability is guaranteed by Lyapunov theory. Moreover, this control algorithm can be applied to the three basic nonholonomic navigation problems: tracking a reference trajectory, path following, and stabilization about a desired posture. The result is a general structure for controlling a mobile robot that can accommodate different control techniques, rang-ing from a conventional computed-torque controller, when all dynamics are known, to robust-adaptive controllers if this is not the case. A robust-adaptive controller based on neural networks (NNs) is proposed in this work. The NN controller can deal with unmodeled bounded disturbances and/or unstructured unmodeled dynamics in the vehicle. On-line NN weight tuning algorithms that do not require off-line learning yet guarantee small tracking errors and bounded control signals are utilized.", "cluster": "1", "citations": [280506980, 262563251, 280530176, 274096233, 272887990, 270222652, 266798448, 263240619, 261207352, 261270374], "references": [244436730, 237873836, 220224643, 226439292], "authors": ["‚óè R Fierro", "F L Lewis"], "title": "Control of nonholonomic mobile robot: backstepping kinematics into dynamics"}
