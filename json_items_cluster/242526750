{"id": 242526750, "abstract": "This article deals with the optimal design of ground vehicles and their subsystems, with particular reference to ‘active’ safety and comfort. A review of state-of-the-art optimization methods for solving vehicle system design problems, including the integration of electronic controls, is given, thus further encouraging the use of such methods as standard tools for automotive engineers. Particular attention is devoted to the class of methods pertaining to complex system design optimization, as well as approaches for the optimal design of complex systems under uncertainty. Some examples of design optimizations are given in the fields of vehicle system dynamics, powertrain/internal combustion engine design, active safety and ride comfort, vehicle system design and lightweight structures, advanced automotive electronics, and smart vehicles.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [281367447, 267588928, 228355082, 23244862, 264438610, 216457235, 264815546, 254220964, 254221193, 271629906], "references": [30870312, 242360316, 245390394, 238190654, 241601022, 239431122, 245401273, 252171274, 245401426, 245401450], "authors": ["M.
