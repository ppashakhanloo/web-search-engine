{"id": 262840808, "abstract": "The analysis of high dimensional survival data is challenging, primarily due\nto the problem of overfitting which occurs when spurious relationships are\ninferred from data that subsequently fail to exist in test data. Here we\npropose a novel method of extracting a low dimensional rep- resentation of\nsurvival data by combining the popular Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model\n(GPLVM) with a Weibull Proportional Hazards Model (WPHM). The model offers a\nflexible non-linear probabilistic method of detecting and extracting any\nintrinsic lower dimensional structure from high dimensional data. In addition\nwe can simultaneously combine information from multiple data sources. We\npresent results from several simulation studies that illustrate a reduction in\noverfitting and an increase in predictive performance, as well as successful\ndetection of intrinsic dimensionality.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [238309671, 228612687, 24432703, 24020396, 220320714, 220320201, 220320635, 260089482, 220270185, 221040325], "authors": ["James E.
