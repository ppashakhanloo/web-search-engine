{"id": 226031060, "abstract": "This paper discusses a novel strategy for simulating rare events and an associated Monte Carlo estimation of tail probabilities.\nOur method uses a system of interacting particles and exploits a Feynman-Kac representation of that system to analyze their\nfluctuations. Our precise analysis of the variance of a standard multilevel splitting algorithm reveals an opportunity for\nimprovement. This leads to a novel method that relies on adaptive levels and produces, in the limit of an idealized version\nof the algorithm, estimates with optimal variance. The motivation for this theoretical work comes from problems occurring\nin watermarking and fingerprinting of digital contents, which represents a new field of applications of rare event simulation\ntechniques. Some numerical results show performance close to the idealized version of our technique for these practical applications.\n\nKeywordsRare event–Sequential importance sampling–Feynman-Kac formula–Metropolis-Hastings–Fingerprinting–Watermarking", "cluster": "5", "citations": [284900779, 282570552, 281895996, 269876959, 281312187, 280243098, 285321983, 285310904, 279070817, 276343589], "references": [228591568, 1825409, 220286431, 29617444, 200707517, 38357609, 225469492, 31403274, 2864441, 3084692], "authors": ["Frédéric Cérou", "Pierre Del Moral", "Teddy Furon", "Arnaud Guyader"], "title": "Sequential Monte Carlo for rare event estimation"}
