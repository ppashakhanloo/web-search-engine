{"id": 280498317, "abstract": "Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) is generalized in terms of a spectrum of\nstratified sampling (SS) designs referred to as partially stratified sample\n(PSS) designs. True SS and LHS are shown to represent the extremes of the PSS\nspectrum. The variance of PSS estimates is derived along with some asymptotic\nproperties. PSS designs are shown to reduce variance associated with variable\ninteractions, whereas LHS reduces variance associated with main effects.\nChallenges associated with the use of PSS designs and their limitations are\ndiscussed. To overcome these challenges, the PSS method is coupled with a new\nmethod called Latinized stratified sampling (LSS) that produces sample sets\nthat are simultaneously SS and LHS. The LSS method is equivalent to an\nOrthogonal Array based LHS under certain conditions but is easier to obtain.\nUtilizing an LSS on the subspaces of a PSS provides a sampling strategy that\nreduces variance associated with both main effects and variable interactions\nand can be designed specially to minimize variance for a given problem. Several\nhigh-dimensional numerical examples highlight the strengths and limitations of\nthe method. The Latinized partially stratified sampling method is then applied\nto identify the best sample strategy for uncertainty quantification on a plate\nbuckling problem.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [222490346, 216756610, 216756608, 223818049, 235709905, 31104170, 243102952, 215519811, 276211091, 245315385], "authors": ["Michael D.
