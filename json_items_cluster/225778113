{"id": 225778113, "abstract": "A method for linearly constrained optimization which modifies and generalizes recent box-constraint optimization algorithms\nis introduced. The new algorithm is based on a relaxed form of Spectral Projected Gradient iterations. Intercalated with these\nprojected steps, internal iterations restricted to faces of the polytope are performed, which enhance the efficiency of the\nalgorithm. Convergence proofs are given and numerical experiments are included and commented.
