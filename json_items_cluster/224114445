{"id": 224114445, "abstract": "Nonparametric Bayesian techniques are considered for learning dictionaries for sparse data representations, with applications in sparse rendering of sensor data. The beta process is employed as a prior for learning the dictionary, and this nonparametric method naturally infers an appropriate dictionary size. The proposed method can learn a sparse dictionary, and may also be used to denoise a signal under test. The noise variance need not be known, and can be non-stationary. The dictionary coefficients for a given sensor signal may be employed within a classifier. Several example results are presented, using both Gibbs and variational Bayesian inference, with comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [254009006, 254054096, 290390475], "references": [26268043, 6645277, 220848162, 221344789, 220321011, 221997039, 216792739, 1775282, 224309574, 2413122], "authors": ["Mingyuan Zhou", "John Paisley", "Lawrence Carin"], "title": "Nonparametric learning of dictionaries for sparse representation of sensor signals"}
