{"id": 259483079, "abstract": "We propose a technique to improve the search efficiency of the bag-of-words\n(BoW) method for image retrieval. We introduce a notion of difficulty for the\nimage matching problems and propose methods that reduce the amount of\ncomputations required for the feature vector-quantization task in BoW by\nexploiting the fact that easier queries need less computational resources.\nMeasuring the difficulty of a query and stopping the search accordingly is\nformulated as a stopping problem. We introduce stopping rules that terminate\nthe image search depending on the difficulty of each query, thereby\nsignificantly reducing the computational cost. Our experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of our approach when it is applied to appearance-based\nlocalization problem.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [269721775], "references": [215458901, 225761164, 228057769, 4246228, 221996154, 224252433, 220692721, 221304115, 275057952, 220122428], "authors": ["Kiana Hajebi", "Hong Zhang"], "title": "Stopping Rules for Bag-of-Words Image Search and Its Application in Appearance-Based Localization"}
