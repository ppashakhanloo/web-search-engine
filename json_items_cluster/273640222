{"id": 273640222, "abstract": "Light and Widely Applicable (LWA-) MCMC is a novel approximation of the\nMetropolis-Hastings kernel targeting a posterior distribution defined on a\nlarge number of observations. Inspired by Approximate Bayesian Computation, we\ndesign a Markov chain whose transition makes use of an unknown but fixed,\nfraction of the available data, where the random choice of sub-sample is guided\nby the fidelity of this sub-sample to the observed data, as measured by summary\n(or sufficient) statistics. LWA-MCMC is a generic and flexible approach, as\nillustrated by the diverse set of examples which we explore. In each case\nLWA-MCMC yields excellent performance and in some cases a dramatic improvement\ncompared to existing methodology.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [227599998, 243764505, 2453431, 45910632, 38322292, 41706878, 27468515, 272027397, 261065488, 261065671], "authors": ["Florian Maire", "Nial Friel", "Pierre Alquier"], "title": "Light and Widely Applicable MCMC: Approximate Bayesian Inference for Large Datasets"}
