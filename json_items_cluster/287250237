{"id": 287250237, "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to develop a method for automatically detecting and\ntracking topics in broadcast news. We present a hierarchical And-Or graph (AOG)\nto jointly represent the latent structure of both texts and visuals. The AOG\nembeds a context sensitive grammar that can describe the hierarchical\ncomposition of news topics by semantic elements about people involved, related\nplaces and what happened, and model contextual relationships between elements\nin the hierarchy. We detect news topics through a cluster sampling process\nwhich groups stories about closely related events. Swendsen-Wang Cuts (SWC), an\neffective cluster sampling algorithm, is adopted for traversing the solution\nspace and obtaining optimal clustering solutions by maximizing a Bayesian\nposterior probability. Topics are tracked to deal with the continuously updated\nnews streams. We generate topic trajectories to show how topics emerge, evolve\nand disappear over time. The experimental results show that our method can\nexplicitly describe the textual and visual data in news videos and produce\nmeaningful topic trajectories. Our method achieves superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods on both a public dataset Reuters-21578 and\na self-collected dataset named UCLA Broadcast News Dataset.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [2378662, 262175901, 221620547, 221345245, 268289418, 257069359, 221573505, 3321709, 4996917, 251801077], "authors": ["Weixin Li", "Jungseock Joo", "Hang Qi", "Song-Chun Zhu"], "title": "Joint Image-Text News Topic Detection and Tracking with And-Or Graph Representation"}
