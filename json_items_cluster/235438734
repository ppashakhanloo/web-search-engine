{"id": 235438734, "abstract": "We develop a Bayesian nonparametric model for reconstructing magnetic\nresonance images (MRI) from highly undersampled k-space data. Our model uses\nthe beta process as a nonparametric prior for dictionary learning, in which an\nimage patch is a sparse combination of dictionary elements. The size of the\ndictionary and the patch-specific sparsity pattern is inferred from the data,\nin addition to all dictionary learning variables. Dictionary learning is\nperformed as part of the image reconstruction process, and so is tailored to\nthe MRI being considered. In addition, we investigate a total variation penalty\nterm in combination with the dictionary learning model. We derive a stochastic\noptimization algorithm based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for\nthe Bayesian model, and use the alternating direction method of multipliers\n(ADMM) for efficiently performing total variation minimization. We present\nempirical results on several MRI, which show that the proposed regularization\nframework can improve reconstruction accuracy over other methods.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [285459028, 281312319, 281058600, 280840028, 276890267, 269726850, 277726010, 283197609], "references": [3085733, 5877310, 209634070, 209634094, 23713397, 23678141, 224117963, 228668807, 221400797, 220322243], "authors": ["Yue Huang", "John Paisley", "Qin Lin", "Xinghao Ding", "Xueyang Fu", "Xiao-ping Zhang"], "title": "Bayesian Nonparametric Dictionary Learning for Compressed Sensing MRI"}
