{"id": 3327141, "abstract": "The advent of large image databases (>10000) has created a need\nfor tools which can search and organize images automatically by their\ncontent. This paper focuses on the use of hierarchical tree-structures\nto both speed-up search-by-query and organize databases for effective\nbrowsing. The first part of this paper develops a fast search algorithm\nbased on best-first branch and bound search. This algorithm is designed\nso that speed and accuracy may be continuously traded-off through the\nselection of a parameter Î». We find that the algorithm is most\neffective when used to perform an approximate search, where it can\ntypically reduce computation by a factor of 20-40 for accuracies ranging\nfrom 80% to 90%. We then present a method for designing a hierarchical\nbrowsing environment which we call a similarity pyramid. The similarity\npyramid groups similar images together while allowing users to view the\ndatabase at varying levels of resolution. We show that the similarity\npyramid is best constructed using agglomerative (bottom up) clustering\nmethods, and present a fast sparse clustering method which dramatically\nreduces both memory and computation over conventional methods", "cluster": "0", "citations": [283494704, 257466098, 255608832, 262215774, 224569372, 265218915, 228585430, 246906695, 222838684, 4351586], "references": [221130135, 243671799, 234803118, 224184955, 49256909, 243647351, 220688589, 220979662, 2332909, 2823079], "authors": ["Jau-Yuen Chen", "C.A.
