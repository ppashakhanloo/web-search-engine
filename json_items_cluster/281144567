{"id": 281144567, "abstract": "Independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical method for transforming\nan observable multidimensional random vector into components that are as\nstatistically independent as possible from each other.Usually the ICA framework\nassumes a model according to which the observations are generated (such as a\nlinear transformation with additive noise). ICA over finite fields is a special\ncase of ICA in which both the observations and the independent components are\nover a finite alphabet. In this work we consider a generalization of this\nframework in which an observation vector is decomposed to its independent\ncomponents (as much as possible) with no prior assumption on the way it was\ngenerated. This generalization is also known as Barlow's minimal redundancy\nrepresentation problem and is considered an open problem. We propose several\ntheorems and show that this NP hard problem can be accurately solved with a\nbranch and bound search tree algorithm, or tightly approximated with a series\nof linear problems. Our contribution provides the first efficient and\nconstructive set of solutions to Barlow's problem.The minimal redundancy\nrepresentation (also known as factorial code) has many applications, mainly in\nthe fields of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. The Binary ICA (BICA) is also\nshown to have applications in several domains including medical diagnosis,\nmulti-cluster assignment, network tomography and internet resource management.\nIn this work we show this formulation further applies to multiple disciplines\nin source coding such as predictive coding, distributed source coding and\ncoding of large alphabet sources.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [], "references": [226212540, 2840751, 221328903, 262030045, 222544435, 202232988, 3351353, 260359889, 228092026, 239019148], "authors": ["Amichai Painsky", "Saharon Rosset", "Meir Feder"], "title": "Generalized Independent Component Analysis Over Finite Alphabets"}
