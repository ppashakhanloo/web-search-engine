{"id": 234113987, "abstract": "In this article we propose an improvement on the sequential updating and\ngreedy search (SUGS) algorithm Wang and Dunson for fast fitting of Dirichlet\nprocess mixture models. The SUGS algorithm provides a means for very fast\napproximate Bayesian inference for mixture data which is particularly of use\nwhen data sets are so large that many standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nalgorithms cannot be applied efficiently, or take a prohibitively long time to\nconverge. In particular, these ideas are used to initially interrogate the\ndata, and to refine models such that one can potentially apply exact data\nanalysis later on. SUGS relies upon sequentially allocating data to clusters\nand proceeding with an update of the posterior on the subsequent allocations\nand parameters which assumes this allocation is correct. Our modification\nsoftens this approach, by providing a probability distribution over\nallocations, with a similar computational cost; this approach has an\ninterpretation as a variational Bayes procedure and hence we term it\nvariational SUGS (VSUGS). It is shown in simulated examples that VSUGS can\nout-perform, in terms of density estimation and classification, the original\nSUGS algorithm in many scenarios. In addition, we present a data analysis for\nflow cytometry data, and SNP data via a three-class dirichlet process mixture\nmodel illustrating the apparent improvement over SUGS.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [283433373], "references": [238866339, 2741222, 38357862, 2468788, 38359078, 254212736, 27290603, 221995544, 38357646, 38357634], "authors": ["David J.
