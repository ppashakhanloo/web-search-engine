{"id": 254257855, "abstract": "When training and testing data are drawn from different distributions, most statis-tical models need to be retrained using the newly collected data. Transfer learning is a family of algorithms that improves the classifier learning in a target domain of interest by transferring the knowledge from one or multiple source domains, where the data falls in a different distribution. In this paper, we consider a new scenario of transfer learning for two-class classification, where only data samples from one of the two classes (e.g., the negative class) are available in the target domain. We introduce a regression-based one-class transfer learning algorithm to tackle this new problem. In contrast to the traditional discriminative feature selection, which seeks the best classification performance in the training data, we propose a new framework to learn the most transferable discriminative features suitable for our transfer learning. The experiment demonstrates improved per-formance in the applications of facial expression recognition and facial landmark detection.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [261375064, 271737554, 263813249, 284735023, 283017569], "references": [222301239, 4047465, 222574859, 221573004, 224604612, 49628576, 220073002, 258055965, 41781559, 221620154], "authors": ["Jixu Chen", "Xiaoming Liu"], "title": "Transfer Learning with One-Class Data"}
