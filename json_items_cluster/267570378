{"id": 267570378, "abstract": "The beta-negative binomial process (BNBP), an integer-valued stochastic\nprocess, is employed to partition a count vector into a latent random count\nmatrix. As the marginal probability distribution of the BNBP that governs the\nexchangeable random partitions of grouped data has not yet been developed,\ncurrent inference for the BNBP has to truncate the number of atoms of the beta\nprocess. This paper introduces an exchangeable partition probability function\nto explicitly describe how the BNBP clusters the data points of each group into\na random number of exchangeable partitions, which are shared across all the\ngroups. A fully collapsed Gibbs sampler is developed for the BNBP, leading to a\nnovel nonparametric Bayesian topic model that is distinct from existing ones,\nwith simple implementation, fast convergence, good mixing, and state-of-the-art\npredictive performance.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [266856377, 271080200, 283619503], "references": [38357634, 38348889, 46451644, 226817979, 220270095, 51965593, 51955773, 266856377, 264005459, 38359431], "authors": ["Mingyuan Zhou"], "title": "Beta-Negative Binomial Process and Exchangeable Random Partitions for Mixed-Membership Modeling"}
