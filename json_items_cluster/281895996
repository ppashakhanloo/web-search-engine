{"id": 281895996, "abstract": "An important task of uncertainty quantification is to identify {the\nprobability of} undesired events, in particular, system failures, caused by\nvarious sources of uncertainties. In this work we consider the construction of\nGaussian {process} surrogates for failure detection and failure probability\nestimation. In particular, we consider the situation that the underlying\ncomputer models are extremely expensive, and in this setting, determining the\nsampling points in the state space is of essential importance. We formulate the\nproblem as an optimal experimental design for Bayesian inferences of the limit\nstate (i.e., the failure boundary) and propose an efficient numerical scheme to\nsolve the resulting optimization problem. In particular, the proposed\nlimit-state inference method is capable of determining multiple sampling points\nat a time, and thus it is well suited for problems where multiple computer\nsimulations can be performed in parallel. The accuracy and performance of the\nproposed method is demonstrated by both academic and practical examples.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [3082726, 222780925, 222546544, 241707735, 46587486, 253769405, 256744276, 256744084, 244955839, 226031060], "authors": ["Hongqiao Wang", "Guang Lin", "Jinglai Li"], "title": "Gaussian process surrogates for failure detection: a Bayesian experimental design approach"}
