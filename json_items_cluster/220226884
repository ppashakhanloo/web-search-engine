{"id": 220226884, "abstract": "This article considers the application of the unscented transformation to approximate fixed-interval optimal smoothing of continuous-time non-linear stochastic dynamic systems. The proposed methodology can be applied to systems, where the dynamics can be modeled with non-linear stochastic differential equations and the noise corrupted measurements are obtained continuously or at discrete times. The smoothing algorithm is based on computing the continuous-time limit of the recently proposed unscented Rauch–Tung–Striebel smoother, which is an approximate optimal smoothing algorithm for discrete-time stochastic dynamic systems.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [260347981, 224068714, 49844161, 233560852, 261489890, 227716489, 256935229, 258794013, 278693647, 256994072], "references": [215721589, 227621957, 222784162, 3028808, 36142880, 3033057, 230873432, 224334106, 3114799, 3115576], "authors": ["Simo Särkkä"], "title": "Continuous-time and continuous-discrete-time unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothers"}
