{"id": 243620125, "abstract": "This paper deals with methods of “cluster analysis”. In particular we attack the problem of exploring the structure of multivariate data in search of “clusters”.The approach taken is to use a computer procedure to obtain the “best” partition of n objects into g groups. A number of mathematical criteria for “best” are discussed and related to statistical theory. A procedure for optimizing the criteria is outlined. Some of the criteria are compared with respect to their behavior on actual data. Results of data analysis are presented and discussed.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [280602554, 264541639, 257566397, 256838838, 259171023, 233818803, 220286643, 225422698, 220176198, 224181324], "references": [216300608, 24061627, 242580910, 224434544, 254283072, 243753741, 50336198, 243768645, 242528750, 224839970], "authors": ["H.
