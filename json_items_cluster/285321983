{"id": 285321983, "abstract": "This paper addresses the issue of estimating extreme probability and quantile on the output of complex computer codes. We introduce a new approach to this problem in term of a random walk in the output space. This allows us to derive two main results: (1) the number of samples required to get a realisation of a random variable in a given domain of probability measure p is drastically reduced, following a Poisson law with parameter log 1/p; and (2) we get parallel algorithms for estimating probabilities and quantiles and especially the optimal parallel Multilevel Splitting algorithm where there is indeed no subset to define anymore.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [284750937], "references": [265727384, 222546544, 251516552, 262108949, 226031060, 245284895, 51888191, 2469281, 225348983, 31403274], "authors": ["Cl√©ment Walter", "gilles defaux"], "title": "Rare Event Simulation: A Point Process Interpretation With Application In Probability And Quantile Estimation"}
