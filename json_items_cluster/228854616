{"id": 228854616, "abstract": "In this paper we present an evolutionary algorithm for solving the nutrition problem of composing and balancing healthy meals. We treat this problem as a single-objective and multiconstrained fractional knapsack problem that is easy to formulate, yet, its decision problem is in the class of NP-complete problems. In other words, some heuristic algorithm is required to provide good problem solutions in reasonable (polynomial) computational time. We applied a genetic algorithm and modified its parameters to yield high-quality and reliable solutions (healthy and balanced meals) that respect multiple weakly-correlated dietary recommendations and guidelines and include as much seasonal functional foods as possible. Functional foods contain physiologically active compounds that provide health benefits beyond their nutrient contributions.
