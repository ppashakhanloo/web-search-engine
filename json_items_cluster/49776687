{"id": 49776687, "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient coarse-to-fine multiresolution framework for multidimensional scaling and demonstrate its performance on a large-scale nonlinear dimensionality reduction and embedding problem in a texture feature extraction step for the unsupervised image segmentation problem. We demonstrate both the efficiency of our multiresolution algorithm and its real interest to learn a nonlinear low-dimensional representation of the texture feature set of an image which can then subsequently be exploited in a simple clustering-based segmentation algorithm. The resulting segmentation procedure has been successfully applied on the Berkeley image database, demonstrating its efficiency compared to the best existing state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [291100004, 266226481, 51930634, 233791000, 261335360, 286396472, 233790984, 261036936, 257484782, 261226139], "references": [221669680, 44572779, 5608591, 43079808, 2477494, 215721562, 7638464, 3302826, 221345819, 5462957], "authors": ["Max Mignotte"], "title": "MDS-Based Multiresolution Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction Model for Color Image Segmentation"}
