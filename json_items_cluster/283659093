{"id": 283659093, "abstract": "Standard Gaussian Process (GP) regression, a powerful machine learning tool,\nis computationally expensive when it is applied to large datasets, and\npotentially inaccurate when data points are sparsely distributed in a\nhigh-dimensional feature space. To address these challenges, a new multiscale,\nsparsified GP algorithm is formulated, with the goal of application to large\nscientific computing datasets. In this approach, the data is partitioned into\nclusters and the cluster centers are used to define a reduced training set,\nresulting in an improvement over standard GPs in terms of training and\nevaluation costs. Further, a hierarchical technique is used to adaptively map\nthe local covariance representation to the underlying sparsity of the feature\nspace, leading to improved prediction accuracy when the data distribution is\nhighly non-uniform. A theoretical investigation of the computational complexity\nof the algorithm is presented. The efficacy of this method is then demonstrated\non simple analytical functions and on data from a direct numerical simulation\nof turbulent combustion.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [4000717, 220907292, 274012895, 262071453, 258082179, 220412257, 220049369, 245793828, 281152547, 239370673], "authors": ["Z.
