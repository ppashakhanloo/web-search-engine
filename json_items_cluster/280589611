{"id": 280589611, "abstract": "Target tracking faces the challenge in coping with large volumes of data\nwhich requires efficient methods for real time applications. The complexity\nconsidered in this paper is when there is a large number of measurements which\nare required to be processed at each time step. Sequential Markov chain Monte\nCarlo (MCMC) has been shown to be a promising approach to target tracking in\ncomplex environments, especially when dealing with clutter. However, a large\nnumber of measurements usually results in large processing requirements. This\npaper goes beyond the current state-of-the-art and presents a novel Sequential\nMCMC approach that can overcome this challenge through adaptively subsampling\nthe set of measurements. Instead of using the whole large volume of available\ndata, the proposed algorithm performs a trade off between the number of\nmeasurements to be used and the desired accuracy of the estimates to be\nobtained in the presence of clutter. We show results with large improvements in\nprocessing time, more than 40% with a negligible loss in tracking performance,\ncompared with the solution without subsampling.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [271512854, 3361206, 4772026, 261433457, 220286671, 7483794, 224114417, 236235190, 220151284, 256606492], "authors": ["Allan De Freitas", "Fran√ßois Septier", "Lyudmila Mihaylova", "Simon J.
