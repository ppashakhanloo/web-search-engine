{"id": 269417452, "abstract": "We propose a practical and scalable Gaussian process model for large-scale\nnonlinear probabilistic regression. Our mixture-of-experts model is\nconceptually simple and hierarchically recombines computations for an overall\napproximation of a full Gaussian process. Closed-form and distributed\ncomputations allow for efficient and massive parallelisation while keeping the\nmemory consumption small. Given sufficient computing resources, our model can\nhandle arbitrarily large data sets, without explicit sparse approximations. We\nprovide strong experimental evidence that our model can be applied to large\ndata sets of sizes far beyond millions. Hence, our model has the potential to\nlay the foundation for general large-scale Gaussian process research.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [279864328], "references": [48166394, 224839774, 232805135, 263812910, 220320007, 220320714, 234779817, 41782142, 2538401, 247598156], "authors": ["Jun Wei Ng", "Marc Peter Deisenroth"], "title": "Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Model for Large-Scale Gaussian Process Regression"}
