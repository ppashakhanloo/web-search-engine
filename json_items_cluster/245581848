{"id": 245581848, "abstract": "This chapter discusses Bayesian density estimation by mixtures of normal distributions and discusses the estimation of an arbitrary density f(x) on the real line. This density is modeled as a mixture of a countable number of normal distributions. Using such mixtures, any distribution on the real line can be approximated to within any preassigned accuracy in the Levy metric and any density on the real line can be approximated similarly in the L1 norm. Thus, the problem can be considered nonparametric. Asymptotic theory for kernel estimators involves the problems of letting the window size tend to zero at some rate as the sample size tends to infinity.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [281144584, 280062418, 271212566, 260026549, 224775666, 263386498, 257522677, 250920750, 266283785, 51947849], "references": [], "authors": ["Thomas S.
