{"id": 238951707, "abstract": "Sampling from distributions to find the one with the largest mean arises in a\nbroad range of applications, and it can be mathematically modeled as a\nmulti-armed bandit problem in which each distribution is associated with an\narm. This paper studies the sample complexity of identifying the best arm\n(largest mean) in a multi-armed bandit problem. Motivated by large-scale\napplications, we are especially interested in identifying situations where the\ntotal number of samples that are necessary and sufficient to find the best arm\nscale linearly with the number of arms. We present a single-parameter\nmulti-armed bandit model that spans the range from linear to superlinear sample\ncomplexity. We also give a new algorithm for best arm identification, called\nPRISM, with linear sample complexity for a wide range of mean distributions.\nThe algorithm, like most exploration procedures for multi-armed bandits, is\nadaptive in the sense that the next arms to sample are selected based on\nprevious samples. We compare the sample complexity of adaptive procedures with\nsimpler non-adaptive procedures using new lower bounds. For many problem\ninstances, the increased sample complexity required by non-adaptive procedures\nis a polynomial factor of the number of arms.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [259478458, 233865906, 242014552], "references": [233865906, 221497549, 51944662, 221394179, 5237790, 224599535], "authors": ["Kevin Jamieson", "Matthew Malloy", "Robert Nowak", "Sebastien Bubeck"], "title": "On Finding the Largest Mean Among Many"}
