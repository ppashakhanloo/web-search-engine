{"id": 2836794, "abstract": "This paper shows that importance sampling can be iterated to produce more accurate approximations to iid sampling from a target distribution, than sequential sampling from an MCMC algorithm. We first illustrate the adaptability of the joint scheme on a toy mixture example. As a more realistic example, we then reanalyse the ion channel model of Hodgson (1999), using an importance sampling scheme based on a hidden Markov representation. The degeneracy phenomenon that usually occurs in particle systems is studied on both examples", "cluster": "5", "citations": [283507766, 280773011, 262298135, 259119094, 260166946, 260306940, 264466468, 236578354, 233391051, 46515713], "references": [4995513, 4771947, 248413507, 2670104, 243773113, 38322292, 2468774, 2453431, 2763514, 246902471], "authors": ["Arnaud Guillin", "Jean-Michel Marin", "Christian P.
