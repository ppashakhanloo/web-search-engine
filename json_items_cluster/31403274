(1953) is presented along with an exposition of the relevant theory, techniques of application and methods and difficulties\nof assessing the error in Monte Carlo estimates. Examples of the methods, including the generation of random orthogonal matrices\nand potential applications of the methods to numerical problems arising in statistics, are discussed.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [282186640, 289587906, 288178678, 288713874, 281487416, 286301698, 285755464, 285648315, 281576035, 287109649], "references": [242511027, 25393898, 17525079, 31965650, 38365933, 261682012, 246868729, 225828439, 221669734, 200104711], "authors": ["W.
