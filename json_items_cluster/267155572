{"id": 267155572, "abstract": "Now that Affective Computing and Social Signal Process-ing methods are becoming increasingly robust and accu-rate, novel areas of applications with significant societal im-pact are opening up for exploration. Perhaps one of the most promising areas is the application of automatic expres-sive behaviour understanding to help diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions that themselves alter a person's so-cial and affective signals. This work argues that this is now essentially a new area of research, called behaviomedics. It gives a definition of the area, discusses the most important groups of medical conditions that could benefit from this, and makes suggestions for future directions.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [275261019, 271372732, 272142354, 275259777, 276273424], "references": [236017807, 8157458, 261032964, 19253125, 258713575, 224172364, 224088064, 19171615, 233600178, 260562140], "authors": ["Michel Valstar"], "title": "Automatic Behaviour Understanding in Medicine"}
