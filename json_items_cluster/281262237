{"id": 281262237, "abstract": "We propose a novel approach WASP for Bayesian inference when massive size of\nthe data prohibits posterior computations. WASP is estimated in three steps.\nFirst, data are divided into smaller computationally tractable subsets. Second,\nposterior draws of parameters are obtained for every subset after modifying\nsubset posteriors using stochastic approximation. Finally, the empirical\nmeasures of samples from each subset posterior are combined through their\nbarycenter in the Wasserstein space of probability measures. Stochastic\napproximation ensures that posterior uncertainty quantification of the\nbarycenter matches with that of the full data posterior distribution. The\ncombining step can be conducted efficiently through a sparse linear program,\nwhich takes negligible time relative to sampling from subset posteriors,\nfacilitating scaling to massive data. WASP is very general and allows\napplication of existing sampling algorithms to massive data with minimal\nmodifications. We provide theoretical conditions under which rate of\nconvergence of WASP to the delta measure centered at the true parameter\ncoincides with the optimal parametric rate up to a logarithmic factor. WASP is\napplied for scalable Bayesian computations in a nonparametric mixture model and\na movie recommender database containing tens of millions of ratings.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [228095582, 279236477, 38358774, 236255250, 2684281, 23528551, 38348833, 243785736, 281058916, 261144450], "authors": ["Sanvesh Srivastava", "Cheng Li", "David B.
