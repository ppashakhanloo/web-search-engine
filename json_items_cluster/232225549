{"id": 232225549, "abstract": "Motivation: The integration of multiple datasets remains a key challenge in systems biology and genomic medicine. Modern high-throughput technologies generate a broad array of different data types, providing distinct—but often complementary—information. We present a Bayesian method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate information from a wide range of different datasets and data types simultaneously (including the ability to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian processes). Each dataset is modelled using a Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture model, with dependencies between these models captured through parameters that describe the agreement among the datasets.\nResults: Using a set of six artificially constructed time series datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a significant number of datasets simultaneously, and that it successfully captures the underlying structural similarity between the datasets. We also analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae datasets. In the two-dataset case, we show that MDI’s performance is comparable with the present state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the capabilities of current approaches and integrate gene expression, chromatin immunoprecipitation–chip and protein–protein interaction data, to identify a set of protein complexes for which genes are co-regulated during the cell cycle. Comparisons to other unsupervised data integration techniques—as well as to non-integrative approaches—demonstrate that MDI is competitive, while also providing information that would be difficult or impossible to extract using other methods.\nAvailability: A Matlab implementation of MDI is available from http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/systemsbiology/research/software/.\nContact:\nD.L.Wild@warwick.ac.uk\nSupplementary information:\nSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [281290545, 281170584, 259631306, 256071692, 221358598, 256291282, 266028451, 268167037, 259918781, 260559792], "references": [10690191, 8369962, 23149649, 46579536, 13649449, 8159365, 7389357, 7678494, 51717248, 26816872], "authors": ["Paul Kirk", "Jim E Griffin", "Richard S Savage", "Zoubin Ghahramani", "David L Wild"], "title": "Bayesian correlated clustering to integrate multiple datasets"}
