{"id": 3192933, "abstract": "We consider the problem of assigning an input vector to one of m\nclasses by predicting P(c|x) for c=1,...,m. For a two-class problem, the\nprobability of class one given x is estimated by σ(y(x)), where\nσ(y)=1/(1+e<sup>-y</sup>). A Gaussian process prior is placed on\ny(x), and is combined with the training data to obtain predictions for\nnew x points. We provide a Bayesian treatment, integrating over\nuncertainty in y and in the parameters that control the Gaussian process\nprior the necessary integration over y is carried out using Laplace's\napproximation. The method is generalized to multiclass problems (m>2)\nusing the softmax function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nmethod on a number of datasets", "cluster": "2", "citations": [287249271, 281451121, 280773011, 270222737, 266376059, 262954130, 259955074, 262408982, 258247108, 239580276], "references": [245576561, 239059440, 38364549, 3192933, 248728006, 235961592, 256843360, 221932969, 2813278, 38359951], "authors": ["C.K.I.
