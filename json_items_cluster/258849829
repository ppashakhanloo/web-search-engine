{"id": 258849829, "abstract": "We propose a new summary statistic for inhomogeneous intensity-reweighted\nmoment stationary spatio-temporal point processes. The statistic is defined\nthrough the n-point correlation functions of the point process and it\ngeneralises the J-function when stationarity is assumed. We show that our\nstatistic can be represented in terms of the generating functional and that it\nis related to the inhomogeneous K-function. We further discuss its explicit\nform under some specific model assumptions and derive a ratio-unbiased\nestimator. We finally illustrate the use of our statistic on simulated data.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [263891581, 260680357, 273709851], "references": [256198178, 2357909, 227616746, 222834730, 265505608, 23968354, 239845126, 225959139, 232129036, 227522879], "authors": ["O.
