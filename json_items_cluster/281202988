{"id": 281202988, "abstract": "This paper proposes a new Bayesian strategy for the estimation of smooth parameters from nonlinear models. The observed signal is assumed to be corrupted by an independent and non identically (colored) Gaussian distribution. A prior enforcing a smooth temporal evolution of the model parameters is considered. The joint posterior distribution of the unknown parameter vector is then derived. A Gibbs sampler coupled with a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm is proposed which allows samples distributed according to the posterior of interest to be generated and to estimate the unknown\nmodel parameters/hyperparameters. Simulations conducted with synthetic and real satellite altimetric data show the potential of the proposed Bayesian model and the corresponding estimation algorithm for nonlinear regression with smooth estimated parameters.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [3231593, 224215358, 258793023, 44366017, 256821709, 224269799, 259390620, 246598264, 224263852, 261874712], "authors": ["Abderrahim Halimi", "Corinne mailhes", "Jean-Yves tourneret"], "title": "Nonlinear regression using smooth Bayesian estimation"}
