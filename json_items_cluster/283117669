{"id": 283117669, "abstract": "A density estimation method in a Bayesian nonparametric framework is\npresented when recorded data are not coming directly from the distribution of\ninterest, but from a length biased version. From a Bayesian perspective,\nefforts to computationally evaluate posterior quantities conditionally on\nlength biased data were hindered by the inability to circumvent the problem of\na normalizing constant. In this paper we present a novel Bayesian nonparametric\napproach to the length bias sampling problem which circumvents the issue of the\nnormalizing constant. Numerical illustrations as well as a real data example\nare presented and the estimator is compared against its frequentist\ncounterpart, the kernel density estimator for indirect data of Jones (1991).", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [221618348, 4745571, 254287145, 2741222, 38357634, 31102890, 220286498, 5106122, 38359078, 228092010], "authors": ["Spyridon J.
