{"id": 264936676, "abstract": "Many popular statistical models for complex phenomena are intractable, in the\nsense that the likelihood function cannot easily be evaluated, even up to\nproportionality. Bayesian estimation in this setting remains challenging, with\na lack of computational methodology to fully exploit modern processing\ncapabilities. In this paper we introduce novel control variates for intractable\nlikelihoods that can reduce the Monte Carlo variance of Bayesian estimators, in\nsome cases dramatically. We prove that these control variates are well-defined,\nprovide a positive variance reduction and derive optimal tuning parameters that\nare targeted at optimising this variance reduction. Moreover, the methodology\nis highly parallelisable and offers a route to exploit multi-core processing\narchitectures for Bayesian computation. Results presented on the Ising model,\nexponential random graphs and nonlinear stochastic differential equations\nsupport our theoretical findings.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [266747978], "references": [261065488, 24168169, 227522317, 261217260, 265347313, 276259852, 254212133, 221707689, 227601726, 264733541], "authors": ["Nial Friel", "Antonietta Mira", "Chris.
