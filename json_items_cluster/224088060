{"id": 224088060, "abstract": "Various open-source toolkits exist for speech recognition and speech processing. These toolkits have brought a great benefit to the research community, i.e. speeding up research. Yet, no such freely available toolkit exists for automatic affect recognition from speech. We herein introduce a novel open-source affect and emotion recognition engine, which integrates all necessary components in one highly efficient software package. The components include audio recording and audio file reading, state-of-the-art paralinguistic feature extraction and plugable classification modules. In this paper we introduce the engine and extensive baseline results. Pre-trained models for four affect recognition tasks are included in the openEAR distribution. The engine is tailored for multi-threaded, incremental on-line processing of live input in real-time, however it can also be used for batch processing of databases.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [275208397, 269636311, 281276446, 267213794, 262697799, 261235391, 257267505, 229439065, 260591658, 262203674], "references": [221490308, 221491017, 222421400, 237131440, 224711637, 221345676, 220726872, 200777596, 23493444, 228715647], "authors": ["Florian Eyben", "Martin Wollmer", "Bjorn Schuller"], "title": "OpenEAR - Introducing the Munich open-source emotion and affect recognition toolkit"}
