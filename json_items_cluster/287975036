{"id": 287975036, "abstract": "Habitat degradation and harvest have upset the natural buffering mechanism (i.e., portfolio\neffects) of many large-scale multi-stock fisheries by reducing spawning stock diversity that is vital for\ngenerating population stability and resilience. The application of portfolio theory offers a means to guide\nmanagement activities by quantifying the importance of multi-stock dynamics and suggesting\nconservation and restoration strategies to improve naturally occurring portfolio effects. Our application\nof portfolio theory to Lake Erie Sander vitreus (walleye), a large population that is supported by riverine\nand open-lake reef spawning stocks, has shown that portfolio effects generated by annual inter-stock larval\nfish production are currently suboptimal when compared to potential buffering capacity. Reduced\nproduction from riverine stocks has resulted in a single open-lake reef stock dominating larval production,\nand in turn, high inter-annual recruitment variability during recent years. Our analyses have shown (1) a\nweak average correlation between annual river and reef larval production ( ¯q ¼ 0.24), suggesting that a\nnatural buffering capacity exists in the population, and (2) expanded annual production of larvae (potential\nrecruits) from riverine stocks could stabilize the fishery by dampening inter-annual recruitment variation.\nUltimately, our results demonstrate how portfolio theory can be used to quantify the importance of\nspawning stock diversity and guide management on ecologically relevant scales (i.e., spawning stocks)\nleading to greater stability and resilience of multi-stock populations and fisheries.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [200806059, 237176035, 230143100, 272036534, 243634032, 274868083, 228636028, 5998951, 235746033, 229628604], "authors": ["Mark R.
