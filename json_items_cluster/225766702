{"id": 225766702, "abstract": "We studied the characteristics of hand touch with a mechanical device that approximated a handshake, and we then examined\nthe effect of handshake mimicry on assessment of a partner. Two participants interacted with a force-feedback joystick that\nrecorded each of their hand movements individually. The two participants then greeted one another by feeling the recording\nof the other person’s movements via the force-feedback device. For each dyad, one of the participants actually received his\nor her own virtual handshake back under the guise that it was the other person’s virtual handshake. Results demonstrated three\nsignificant findings. First, for any given participant, a metric that took into account position, angle, speed, and acceleration\nof the hand movements correlated highly within individuals across two handshakes. Second, across participants, these metrics\ndemonstrated specific differences by gender. Finally, there was an interaction between gender and mimicry, such that male\nparticipants liked people who mimicked their handshakes more than female participants did. We discuss the implications of\nthese findings and relate them to theories of social interaction.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [257936516, 220395383, 224090579, 227673964, 31283469, 254212788, 228930411, 38006829, 222430190, 49729028], "references": [237130880, 21331530, 249471854, 229532465, 234802824, 223473055, 247504321, 222674581, 248925769, 226098600], "authors": ["Jeremy N.
