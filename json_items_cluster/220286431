{"id": 220286431, "abstract": "We describe a new Monte Carlo algorithm for the consistent and unbiased estimation of multidimensional integrals and the efficient\nsampling from multidimensional densities. The algorithm is inspired by the classical splitting method and can be applied to\ngeneral static simulation models. We provide examples from rare-event probability estimation, counting, and sampling, demonstrating\nthat the proposed method can outperform existing Markov chain sampling methods in terms of convergence speed and accuracy.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [284900779, 275535124, 281157084, 226031060, 254049782, 233065791, 261122380, 257665533, 50908649, 51889883], "references": [228940071, 43525896, 245730532, 2120858, 242381173, 224061436, 2613528, 2595109, 1825409, 226706221], "authors": ["Zdravko I.
