{"id": 236627542, "abstract": "How much dependence is there in the prime factorization of a random integer\ndistributed uniformly from 1 to n? How much dependence is there in the\ndecomposition into cycles of a random permutation of n points? What is the\nrelation between the Poisson-Dirichlet process and the scale invariant Poisson\nprocess? These three questions have essentially the same answers, with respect\nto total variation distance, considering only small components, and with\nrespect to a Wasserstein distance, considering all components. The Wasserstein\ndistance is the expected number of changes -- insertions and deletions --\nneeded to change the dependent system into an independent system.\nIn particular we show that for primes, roughly speaking, 2+o(1) changes are\nnecessary and sufficient to convert a uniformly distributed random integer from\n1 to n into a random integer prod_{p leq n} p^{Z_p} in which the multiplicity\nZ_p of the factor p is geometrically distributed, with all Z_p independent. The\nchanges are, with probability tending to 1, one deletion, together with a\nrandom number of insertions, having expectation 1+o(1).\nThe crucial tool for showing that 2+epsilon suffices is a coupling of the\ninfinite independent model of prime multiplicities, with the scale invariant\nPoisson process on (0,infty). A corollary of this construction is the first\nmetric bound on the distance to the Poisson-Dirichlet in Billingsley's 1972\nweak convergence result. Our bound takes the form: there are couplings in which\nE sum |log P_i(n) - (log n) V_i | = O(\\log \\log n), where P_i denotes the\ni-th largest prime factor and V_i denotes the i-th component of the\nPoisson-Dirichlet process. It is reasonable to conjecture that O(1) is\nachievable.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [259604459, 255787245, 220357797, 51946246], "references": [31071912, 268735906, 243770923, 238869688, 2826951, 22288231, 220345482, 243766298, 240189892, 38363377], "authors": ["Richard Arratia"], "title": "On the Amount of Dependence in the Prime Factorization of a Uniform Random Integer"}
