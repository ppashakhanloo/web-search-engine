{"id": 221618614, "abstract": "This contribution develops a theoretical framework that takes into account the effect of approximate optimization on learning algorithms. The analysis shows distinct tradeoffs for the case of small-scale and large-sc ale learning problems. Small-scale learning problems are subject to the usual approximation-estimation tradeoff. Large-scale learning problems are subject to a qualitatively different tradeoff involving the computational complexity of the underlying optimization algorithms in non-trivial ways.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [291186593, 282863279, 280873163, 280498476, 279633530, 272385688, 277023572, 273918384, 274730183, 273067814], "references": [41781432, 222625567, 2560520, 220500215, 38349018, 4742228, 3087002, 2852039, 220320717, 41712113], "authors": ["LÃ©on Bottou", "Olivier Bousquet"], "title": "The Tradeoffs of Large Scale Learning."}
