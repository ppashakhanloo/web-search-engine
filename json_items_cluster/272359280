{"id": 272359280, "abstract": "Computer simulation has become the standard tool in many engineering fields\nfor designing and optimizing systems, as well as for assessing their\nreliability. To cope with demanding analysis such as optimization and\nreliability, surrogate models (a.k.a meta-models) have been increasingly\ninvestigated in the last decade. Polynomial Chaos Expansions (PCE) and Kriging\nare two popular non-intrusive meta-modelling techniques. PCE surrogates the\ncomputational model with a series of orthonormal polynomials in the input\nvariables where polynomials are chosen in coherency with the probability\ndistributions of those input variables. On the other hand, Kriging assumes that\nthe computer model behaves as a realization of a Gaussian random process whose\nparameters are estimated from the available computer runs, i.e. input vectors\nand response values. These two techniques have been developed more or less in\nparallel so far with little interaction between the researchers in the two\nfields. In this paper, PC-Kriging is derived as a new non-intrusive\nmeta-modeling approach combining PCE and Kriging. A sparse set of orthonormal\npolynomials (PCE) approximates the global behavior of the computational model\nwhereas Kriging manages the local variability of the model output. An adaptive\nalgorithm similar to the least angle regression algorithm determines the\noptimal sparse set of polynomials. PC-Kriging is validated on various benchmark\nanalytical functions which are easy to sample for reference results. From the\nnumerical investigations it is concluded that PC-Kriging performs better than\nor at least as good as the two distinct meta-modeling techniques. A larger gain\nin accuracy is obtained when the experimental design has a limited size, which\nis an asset when dealing with demanding computational models.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [282247205], "references": [234140352, 46587486, 240978407, 251012102, 251620910, 253769405, 240445429, 223079085, 223472072, 51959501], "authors": ["R.
