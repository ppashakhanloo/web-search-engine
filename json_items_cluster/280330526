After discussing\nspecific cases from the literature, we analyse the ergodicity properties of the\nresulting Markov chains. In one dimension we find that suitable choice of\n$G^{-1}(x)$ can change the ergodicity properties compared to the Random Walk\nMetropolis case $\\mathcal{N}(x,h\\Sigma)$, either for the better or worse. In\nhigher dimensions we use a specific example to show that judicious choice of\n$G^{-1}(x)$ can produce a chain which will converge at a geometric rate to its\nlimiting distribution when probability concentrates on an ever narrower ridge\nas $|x|$ grows, something which is not true for the Random Walk Metropolis.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [200105001, 31403274, 47843593, 265465075, 2349384, 4920066, 228789130, 226460107, 250613960, 49458431], "authors": ["Samuel Livingstone"], "title": "Geometric ergodicity of the Random Walk Metropolis with position-dependent proposal covariance"}
