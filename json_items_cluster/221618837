{"id": 221618837, "abstract": "Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture models are promising candidates for clustering applications where the number of clusters is unknown a priori. Due to computational considerations these models are unfortunately unsuitable for large scale data-mining applications. We propose a class of deterministic accelerated DP mixture models that can routinely handle millions of data-cases. The speedup is achieved by incorporating kd-trees into a variational Bayesian algorithm for DP mixtures in the stick-breaking representation, similar to that of Blei and Jordan (2005). Our algorithm differs in the use of kd-trees and in the way we handle truncation: we only assume that the variational distributions are fixed at their priors after a certain level. Experiments show that speedups relative to the standard variational algorithm can be significant.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [266261649, 231582332, 254008792, 51917690, 220320763, 230642974, 221618212, 221653277, 220907305, 37998339], "references": [2360305, 229100417, 220451818, 3832184, 227688851, 221996674, 38357634, 38357862, 30867879, 220319974], "authors": ["Kenichi Kurihara", "Max Welling", "Nikos A.
