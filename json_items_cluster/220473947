{"id": 220473947, "abstract": "The most difficult—and often most essential—aspect of many interception and tracking tasks is constructing motion models of\nthe targets. Experts rarely can provide complete information about a target’s expected motion pattern, and fitting parameters\nfor complex motion patterns can require large amounts of training data. Specifying how to parameterize complex motion patterns\nis in itself a difficult task.\n\nIn contrast, Bayesian nonparametric models of target motion are very flexible and generalize well with relatively little training\ndata. We propose modeling target motion patterns as a mixture of Gaussian processes (GP) with a Dirichlet process (DP) prior\nover mixture weights. The GP provides an adaptive representation for each individual motion pattern, while the DP prior allows\nus to represent an unknown number of motion patterns. Both automatically adjust the complexity of the motion model based on\nthe available data. Our approach outperforms several parametric models on a helicopter-based car-tracking task on data collected\nfrom the greater Boston area.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [265383462, 264977313, 259740974, 268393142, 228923739, 259741069, 254041305, 259740902, 257523145, 262568799], "references": [220141506, 220122597, 26594075, 221606352, 221607147, 226578193, 224318628, 221323008, 221603159, 2375487], "authors": ["Joshua Mason Joseph", "Finale P.
