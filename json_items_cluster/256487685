{"id": 256487685, "abstract": "How users in a dynamic system perform learning and make decision become more\nand more important in numerous research fields. Although there are some works\nin the social learning literatures regarding how to construct belief on an\nuncertain system state, few study has been conducted on incorporating social\nlearning with decision making. Moreover, users may have multiple concurrent\ndecisions on different objects/resources and their decisions usually negatively\ninfluence each other's utility, which makes the problem even more challenging.\nIn this paper, we propose an Indian Buffet Game to study how users in a dynamic\nsystem learn the uncertain system state and make multiple concurrent decisions\nby not only considering the current myopic utility, but also taking into\naccount the influence of subsequent users' decisions. We analyze the proposed\nIndian Buffet Game under two different scenarios: customers request multiple\ndishes without budget constraint and with budget constraint. For both cases, we\ndesign recursive best response algorithms to find the subgame perfect Nash\nequilibrium for customers and characterize special properties of the Nash\nequilibrium profile under homogeneous setting. Moreover, we introduce a\nnon-Bayesian social learning algorithm for customers to learn the system state,\nand theoretically prove its convergence. Finally, we conduct simulations to\nvalidate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [266318450, 287723843, 290454287], "references": [4918179, 254063124, 4995518, 4765783, 225311049, 46556465, 228167671, 235969151, 261046465, 235964437], "authors": ["Chunxiao Jiang", "Yan Chen", "Yang Gao", "K.
