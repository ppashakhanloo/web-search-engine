{"id": 275588369, "abstract": "In this paper we present a novel inference methodology to perform Bayesian\ninference for spatio-temporal Cox processes where the intensity function\ndepends on a multivariate Gaussian process. Dynamic Gaussian processes are\nintroduced to allow for evolution of the intensity function over discrete time.\nThe novelty of the method lies on the fact that no discretisation error is\ninvolved despite the non-tractability of the likelihood function and infinite\ndimensionality of the problem. The method is based on a Markov chain Monte\nCarlo algorithm that samples from the joint posterior distribution of the\nparameters and latent variables of the model. A particular choice of the\ndominating measure to obtain the likelihood function is shown to be crucial to\ndevise a valid MCMC. The models are defined in a general and flexible way but\nthey are amenable to direct sampling from the relevant distributions, due to\ncareful characterisation of its components. The models also allow for the\ninclusion of regression covariates and/or temporal components to explain the\nvariability of the intensity function. These components may be subject to\nrelevant interaction with space and/or time. Simulated examples illustrate the\nmethodology, followed by concluding remarks.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [221346144, 4789174, 250920403, 4772293, 227616746, 26469563, 30996602, 232128445, 264947372, 243767797], "authors": ["Flávio B.
