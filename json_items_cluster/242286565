{"id": 242286565, "abstract": "Informatica is a journal primarily covering the European com- puter science and informatics community; scientific and educa- tional as well as technical, commercial and industrial. Its basic aim is to enhance communications between different European structures on the basis of equal rights and international referee- ing. It publishes scientific papers accepted by at least two ref- erees outside the author's country. In addition, it contains in- formation about conferences, opinions, critical examinations of existing publications and news. Finally, major practical achieve- ments and innovations in the computer and information industry are presented through commercial publications as well as through independent evaluations. Editing and refereeing are distributed. Each editor from the Editorial Board can conduct the refereeing process by appointing two new referees or referees from the Board of Referees or Edi- torial Board. Referees should not be from the author's country. If new referees are appointed, their names will appear in the list of referees. Each paper bears the name of the editor who appointed the referees. Each editor can propose new members for the Edi- torial Board or referees. Editors and referees inactive for a longer period can be automatically replaced. Changes in the Editorial Board are confirmed by the Executive Editors. The coordination necessary is made through the Executive Edi- tors who examine the reviews, sort the accepted articles and main- tain appropriate international distribution. The Executive Board is appointed by the Society Informatika. Informatica is partially supported by the Slovenian Ministry of Science and Technology. Each author is guaranteed to receive the reviews of his article. When accepted, publication in Informatica is guaranteed in less than one year after the Executive Editors receive the corrected version of the article.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [228780474, 240920690, 228894014, 228394697, 220166078, 220166234, 220166303, 220166319, 220166482, 220166672], "authors": ["Tomaû Banovec", "Ciril Baökovi", "Andrej Jerman-Blaûi", "Vladislav Rajkovi", "Ivan Bratko", "Marko Jagodic"], "title": "EDITORIAL BOARDS, PUBLISHING COUNCIL"}
