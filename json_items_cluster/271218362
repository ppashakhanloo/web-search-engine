{"id": 271218362, "abstract": "In applications of Gaussian processes where quantification of uncertainty is\nof primary interest, it is necessary to accurately characterize the posterior\ndistribution over covariance parameters. This paper proposes stochastic\ngradient-based inference to draw samples from the posterior distribution over\ncovariance parameters with negligible bias and without the need to compute the\nmarginal likelihood. In Gaussian process regression, this has the enormous\nadvantage that stochastic gradients can be computed by solving linear systems\nonly. A novel unbiased linear systems solver based on parallelizable covariance\nmatrix-vector products is developed to accelerate the unbiased estimation of\ngradients. The results demonstrate the possibility to enable scalable and exact\n(in a Monte Carlo sense) quantification of uncertainty in Gaussian processes\nwithout imposing any special structures on the covariance or reducing the\nnumber of input vectors.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [282310289, 280773011, 278332447], "references": [220411737, 220857802, 262954130, 257618460, 38363224, 2799236, 2952332, 2533591, 260126902, 13258954], "authors": ["Maurizio Filippone", "Raphael Engler"], "title": "Enabling scalable stochastic gradient-based inference for Gaussian processes by employing the Unbiased LInear System SolvEr (ULISSE)"}
