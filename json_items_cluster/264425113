{"id": 264425113, "abstract": "Finding duplicates in homicide registries is an important step in keeping an\naccurate account of lethal violence. This task is not trivial when unique\nidentifiers of the individuals are not available, and it is especially\nchallenging when records are subject to errors and missing values. Traditional\napproaches to duplicate detection output independent decisions on the\ncoreference status of each pair of records, which often leads to non-transitive\ndecisions that have to be reconciled in some ad-hoc fashion. The task of\nfinding duplicate records in a datafile can be alternatively posed as\npartitioning the datafile into groups of coreferent records. We present an\napproach that targets this partition of the file as the parameter of interest,\nthereby ensuring transitive decisions. Our Bayesian implementation allows us to\nincorporate prior information on the reliability of the fields in the datafile,\nwhich is especially useful when no training data are available, and it also\nprovides a proper account of the uncertainty in the duplicate detection\ndecisions. We present a study to detect killings that were reported multiple\ntimes to the United Nations Truth Commission for El Salvador.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [267099477, 272372982, 277634715], "references": [3454134, 228787127, 3297646, 10923745, 38360237, 262855607, 12464726, 224959407, 26757371, 236639830], "authors": ["Mauricio Sadinle"], "title": "Detecting Duplicates in a Homicide Registry Using a Bayesian Partitioning Approach"}
