{"id": 267099477, "abstract": "Bayesian entity resolution merges together multiple, noisy databases and\nreturns the minimal collection of unique individuals represented, together with\ntheir true, latent record values. Bayesian methods allow flexible generative\nmodels that share power across databases as well as principled quantification\nof uncertainty for queries of the final, resolved database. However, existing\nBayesian methods for entity resolution use Markov monte Carlo method (MCMC)\napproximations and are too slow to run on modern databases containing millions\nor billions of records. Instead, we propose applying variational approximations\nto allow scalable Bayesian inference in these models. We derive a\ncoordinate-ascent approximation for mean-field variational Bayes, qualitatively\ncompare our algorithm to existing methods, note unique challenges for inference\nthat arise from the expected distribution of cluster sizes in entity\nresolution, and discuss directions for future work in this domain.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [2243140, 243786155, 235326519, 264425113, 2468788, 254212736, 260482474, 227317297, 262157385], "authors": ["Tamara Broderick", "Rebecca C.
