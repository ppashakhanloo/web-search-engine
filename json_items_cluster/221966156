{"id": 221966156, "abstract": "Recently, a lot of effort has been paid to the efficient computation of\nKriging predictors when observations are assimilated sequentially. In\nparticular, Kriging update formulae enabling significant computational savings\nwere derived in Barnes and Watson (1992), Gao et al. (1996), and Emery (2009).\nTaking advantage of the previous Kriging mean and variance calculations helps\navoiding a costly $(n+1) \\times (n+1)$ matrix inversion when adding one\nobservation to the $n$ already available ones. In addition to traditional\nupdate formulae taking into account a single new observation, Emery (2009) also\nproposed formulae for the batch-sequential case, i.e. when $r > 1$ new\nobservations are simultaneously assimilated. However, the Kriging variance and\ncovariance formulae given without proof in Emery (2009) for the\nbatch-sequential case are not correct. In this paper we fix this issue and\nestablish corrected expressions for updated Kriging variances and covariances\nwhen assimilating several observations in parallel.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [281895996, 269420296, 228438518, 262369166, 281946744, 281671347], "references": [238354904, 225331924, 225843631, 245285450, 267437693, 226798104], "authors": ["Cl√©ment Chevalier", "David Ginsbourger"], "title": "Corrected Kriging Update Formulae for Batch-Sequential Data Assimilation"}
