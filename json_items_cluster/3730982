{"id": 3730982, "abstract": "A new machine learning algorithm for the diagnosis of cardiac\narrhythmia from standard 12 lead ECG recordings is presented. The\nalgorithm is called VF15 for Voting Feature Intervals. VF15 is a\nsupervised and inductive learning algorithm for inducing classification\nknowledge from examples. The input to VF15 is a training set of records.\nEach record contains clinical measurements, from ECG signals and some\nother information such as sex, age, and weight, along with the decision\nof an expert cardiologist. The knowledge representation is based on a\nrecent technique called Feature Intervals, where a concept is\nrepresented by the projections of the training cases on each feature\nseparately. Classification in VF15 is based on a majority voting among\nthe class predictions made by each feature separately. The comparison of\nthe VF15 algorithm indicates that it outperforms other standard\nalgorithms such as Naive Bayesian and Nearest Neighbor classifiers", "cluster": "2", "citations": [271452528, 220712735, 224370857, 4202702, 221900815, 228931056, 237317380, 237133294, 224891059, 265486013], "references": [2569026, 226693264, 220355948, 221345954, 3730982], "authors": ["H.A.
