{"id": 220848162, "abstract": "A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Independent Components Analysis (ICA) is proposed where observed data Y is modelled as a linear superposition, G, of a potentially infinite number of hidden sources, X. Whether a given source is active for a specific data point is specified by an infinite binary matrix, Z. The resulting sparse representation allows increased data reduction compared to standard ICA. We define a prior on Z using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP). We describe four variants of the model, with Gaussian or Laplacian priors on X and the one or two-parameter IBPs. We demonstrate Bayesian inference under these models using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on synthetic and gene expression data and compare to standard ICA algorithms.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [260623423, 230996489, 239938718, 51948589, 224246550, 47843669, 227113488, 45914785, 224114445, 221346465], "references": [220279494, 229647197, 6265760, 220270203, 227661917, 2242002, 221619194, 2348531, 2611505, 228373683], "authors": ["David Knowles", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "title": "Infinite Sparse Factor Analysis and Infinite Independent Components Analysis"}
