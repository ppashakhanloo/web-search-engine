{"id": 283043210, "abstract": "Robust Bayesian models are appealing alternatives to standard models,\nproviding protection from data that contains outliers or other departures from\nthe model assumptions. Historically, robust models were mostly developed on a\ncase-by-case basis; examples include robust linear regression, robust mixture\nmodels, and bursty topic models. In this paper we develop a general approach to\nrobust Bayesian modeling. We show how to turn an existing Bayesian model into a\nrobust model, and then develop a generic strategy for computing with it. We use\nour method to study robust variants of several models, including linear\nregression, Poisson regression, logistic regression, and probabilistic topic\nmodels. We discuss the connections between our methods and existing approaches,\nespecially empirical Bayes and James-Stein estimation.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [289587906], "references": [228095582, 267956059, 279903864, 35752214, 228884043, 2239998, 236736826, 280940018, 262175901, 1761888], "authors": ["Chong Wang", "David M.
