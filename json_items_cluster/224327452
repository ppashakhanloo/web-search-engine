{"id": 224327452, "abstract": "Hidden Markov random field (HMRF) models have been widely used for image segmentation, as they appear naturally in problems where a spatially constrained clustering scheme, taking into account the mutual influences of neighboring sites, is asked for. Fuzzy c -means (FCM) clustering has also been successfully applied in several image segmentation applications. In this paper, we combine the benefits of these two approaches, by proposing a novel treatment of HMRF models, formulated on the basis of a fuzzy clustering principle. We approach the HMRF model treatment problem as an FCM-type clustering problem, effected by introducing the explicit assumptions of the HMRF model into the fuzzy clustering procedure. Our approach utilizes a fuzzy objective function regularized by Kullback--Leibler divergence information, and is facilitated by application of a mean-field-like approximation of the MRF prior. We experimentally demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over competing methodologies, considering a series of synthetic and real-world image segmentation applications.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [272158669, 264032904, 235960199, 255736754, 237036706, 220601373, 44572779, 224112692, 50282700, 261021839], "references": [233950933, 221669680, 222447226, 267218645, 220467137, 3336562, 11380153, 220323155, 51386846, 3906161], "authors": ["S.P.
