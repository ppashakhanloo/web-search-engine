{"id": 280243098, "abstract": "In this paper we compute and analyse the transition rates and duration of\nreactive trajectories of the stochastic 1-D Allen-Cahn equations for both the\nFreidlin-Wentzell regime (weak noise or temperature limit) and finite-amplitude\nwhite noise, as well as for small and large domain. We demonstrate that\nextremely rare reactive trajectories corresponding to direct transitions\nbetween two metastable states are efficiently computed using an algorithm\ncalled adaptive multilevel splitting. This algorithm is dedicated to the\ncomputation of rare events and is able to provide ensembles of reactive\ntrajectories in a very efficient way. In the small noise limit, our numerical\nresults are in agreement with large-deviation predictions such as\ninstanton-like solutions, mean first passages and escape probabilities. We show\nthat the duration of reactive trajectories follows a Gumbel distribution like\nfor one degree of freedom systems. Moreover, the mean duration growths\nlogarithmically with the inverse temperature. The prefactor given by the\npotential curvature grows exponentially with size. The main novelty of our work\nis that we also perform an analysis of reactive trajectories for large noises\nand large domains. In this case, we show that the position of the reactive\nfront is essentially a random walk. This time, the mean duration grows linearly\nwith the inverse temperature and quadratically with the size. Using a\nphenomenological description of the system, we are able to calculate the\ntransition rate, although the dynamics is described by neither\nFreidlin--Wentzell or Eyring--Kramers type of results. Numerical results\nconfirm our analysis.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [1864798, 51454439, 40811550, 24358343, 51914078, 257685237, 232384843, 227733047, 232028781, 234258576], "authors": ["Joran Rolland", "Freddy Bouchet", "Eric Simonnet"], "title": "Computing transition rates for the 1-D stochastic Ginzburg--Landau--Allen--Cahn equation for finite-amplitude noise with a rare event algorithm"}
