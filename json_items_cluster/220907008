{"id": 220907008, "abstract": "Exploratory data analysis aims to discover and generate mul- tiple views of the structure within a dataset. Conventional clustering techniques, however, are designed to only provide a single grouping or clustering of a dataset. In this paper, we introduce a novel algorithm called CAMI, that can un- cover alternative clusterings from a dataset. CAMI takes a mathematically appealing approach, combining the use of mutual information to distinguish between alternative clus- terings, coupled with an expectation maximization frame- work to ensure clustering quality. We experimentally test CAMI on both synthetic and real-world datasets, compar- ing it against a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms. We demonstrate that CAMI's performance is high and that its formulation provides a number of advantages compared to existing techniques.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [283117782, 220765600, 228950165, 221654001, 267858869, 268393601, 220766442, 51928276, 261282836, 220177075], "references": [220766036, 2914686, 221995544, 220765626, 224384182, 227535738, 3193345, 220283535, 2937359, 220906930], "authors": ["Xuan Hong Dang", "James Bailey"], "title": "Generation of Alternative Clusterings Using the CAMI Approach"}
