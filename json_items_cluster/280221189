{"id": 280221189, "abstract": "Automated sensing instruments on satellites and aircraft have enabled the\ncollection of massive amounts of high-resolution observations of spatial fields\nover large spatial regions. If these datasets can be efficiently exploited,\nthey can provide new insights on a wide variety of issues. However, traditional\nspatial-statistical techniques such as kriging are not computationally feasible\nfor big datasets. We propose a multi-resolution approximation (M-RA) of\nGaussian processes observed at irregular locations in space. The M-RA process\nis specified as a linear combination of basis functions at multiple levels of\nspatial resolution, which can capture spatial structure from very fine to very\nlarge scales. The basis functions are automatically chosen to approximate a\ngiven covariance function, which can be nonstationary. All computations\ninvolving the M-RA, including parameter inference and prediction, are highly\nscalable for massive datasets. Crucially, the inference algorithms can also be\nparallelized to take full advantage of large distributed-memory computing\nenvironments. In comparisons using simulated data and a large satellite\ndataset, the M-RA outperforms a related state-of-the-art method.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [26808285, 241722209, 225612130, 23644989, 231222178, 4993358, 261651521, 277513048, 262576230, 224839818], "authors": ["Matthias Katzfuss"], "title": "A multi-resolution approximation for massive spatial datasets"}
