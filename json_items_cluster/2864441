{"id": 2864441, "abstract": "We construct binary codes for fingerprinting. Our codes for n users that are ϵ-secure against c pirates have length O(c 2 log(n/ϵ)). This improves the codes proposed by D. Boneh and J. Shaw [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 44, 1897–1905 (1998; Zbl 0931.94051)] whose length is approximately the square of this length. Our codes are probabilistic. By proving matching lower bounds we establish that the length of these codes is best within a constant factor for reasonable error probabilities. This lower bound generalizes the bound found independently by C. Peikert, A. Shelat and A. Smith [in: Proceedings of the fourteenth annual ACM-SIAM symposium on discrete algorithms, Baltimore, MD, USA, January 12–14, 2003. New York, NY: Association for Computing Machinery; Philadelphia, PA: Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. 472–479 (2003; Zbl 1092.68605)] that applies to a limited class of codes. Our results also imply that randomized fingerprint codes over a binary alphabet are as powerful as those over an arbitrary alphabet, and also the equal strength of two distinct models for fingerprinting.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [282372777, 280530763, 272193983, 281597600, 273106587, 263163834, 261563273, 261512931, 260604334, 51955218], "references": [3080073, 3080362, 2611541, 220779228, 3084733, 221348217, 220722235, 220342472, 2383546, 221355522], "authors": ["Gabor Tardos"], "title": "Optimal Probabilistic Fingerprint Codes"}
