{"id": 221490308, "abstract": "In this paper, we report on classification results for emotional user states (4 classes, German database of children interacting with a pet robot). Six sites computed acoustic and linguistic features independently from each other, following in part dif- ferent strategies. A total of 4244 features were pooled together and grouped into 12 low level descriptor types and 6 functional types. For each of these groups, classification results using Sup- port Vector Machines and Random Forests are reported for the full set of features, and for 150 features each with the highest individual Information Gain Ratio. The performance for the different groups varies mostly between ≈ 50% and ≈ 60%.
