{"id": 281809119, "abstract": "Social relation defines the association, e.g, warm, friendliness, and\ndominance, between two or more people. Motivated by psychological studies, we\ninvestigate if such fine-grained and high-level relation traits can be\ncharacterised and quantified from face images in the wild. To address this\nchallenging problem we propose a deep model that learns a rich face\nrepresentation to capture gender, expression, head pose, and age-related\nattributes, and then performs pairwise-face reasoning for relation prediction.\nTo learn from heterogeneous attribute sources, we formulate a new network\narchitecture with a bridging layer to leverage the inherent correspondences\namong these datasets. It can also cope with missing target attribute labels.\nExtensive experiments show that our approach is effective for fine-grained\nsocial relation learning in images and videos.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [221304868, 221620245, 262352250, 223134705, 221304440, 221110012, 200026316, 261283556, 240237253, 268619657], "authors": ["Zhanpeng Zhang", "Ping Luo", "Chen Change Loy", "Xiaoou Tang"], "title": "Learning Social Relation Traits from Face Images"}
