{"id": 31002185, "abstract": "SUMMARY A parametric model for partitioning individuals into mutually exclusive groups is given. A Bayesian analysis is applied and\na loss structure imposed. A model-dependent definition of a similarity matrix is proposed and estimates based on this matrix\nare justified in a decision-theoretic framework. Some existing cluster analysis techniques are derived as special limiting\ncases. The results of the procedure applied to two data sets are compared with other analyses.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [267568486, 256762204, 254062888, 241251898, 4993356, 242306947, 228672773, 236670503, 238879801, 226146328], "references": [238675693, 238276659, 243620125, 265372318, 268494464, 239019638, 38358158, 239665622, 31002185, 31002185], "authors": ["D.
