{"id": 262362546, "abstract": "Herein we propose a complete procedure to analyze and classify the\ntexture of an image. We apply this scheme to solve a specific image processing\nproblem: urban areas detection in satellite images. First we propose to\nanalyze the texture through the modelling of the luminance field with eight\ndifferent chain-based models. We then derived a texture parameter from these\nmodels. The effect of the lattice anisotropy is corrected by a renormalization\ngroup technique coming from statistical physics. This parameter, which takes\ninto account local conditional variances of the image, is compared to classical\nmethods of texture analysis. Afterwards we develop a modified fuzzy Cmeans\nalgorithm that includes an entropy term. The advantage of such an algorithm\nis that the number of classes does not need to be known a priori. Besides\nthis algorithm provides us with further information, i.e. the probability\nthat a given pixel belongs to a given cluster. Finally we introduce this\ninformation in a Markovian model of segmentation. Some results on SPOT5\nsimulated images, SPOT3 images and ERS1 radar images are presented. These\nimages are provided by the French National Space Agency (CNES) and\nthe European Space Agency (ESA).", "cluster": "0", "citations": [220645405, 26532206, 228904697, 239563291, 239614586, 30513202, 221089690, 220728690, 3970250, 223344936], "references": [243390446, 226940507, 222141039, 3521506, 3834955, 3315022, 232806209, 243634131, 220024167, 230675353], "authors": ["A.
