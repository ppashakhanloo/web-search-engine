{"id": 227686996, "abstract": "A method introduced by Arjas & Gasbarra (1994) and later modified by Arjas & Heikkinen (1997) for the non-parametric Bayesian estimation of an intensity on the real line is generalized to cover spatial processes. The method is based on a model approximation where the approximating intensities have the structure of a piecewise constant function. Random step functions on the plane are generated using Voronoi tessellations of random point patterns. Smoothing between nearby intensity values is applied by means of a Markov random field prior in the spirit of Bayesian image analysis. The performance of the method is illustrated in examples with both real and simulated data.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [24052917, 223457711, 221653841, 227659607, 267246629, 47932762, 228891160, 237539643, 238446177, 238676203], "references": [2606787, 2670104, 24051882, 232841830, 38363225, 265620657, 227701452, 227686996, 227686996, 227686996], "authors": ["Juha Heikkinen", "Elja Arjas"], "title": "Non‚Äêparametric Bayesian Estimation of a Spatial Poisson Intensity"}
