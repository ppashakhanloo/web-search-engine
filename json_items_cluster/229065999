{"id": 229065999, "abstract": "We present an exact sampling method for the first passage event of a Levy\nprocess. The idea is to embed the process into another one whose first passage\nevent can be sampled exactly, and then recover the part belonging to the former\nfrom the latter. The method is based on several distributional properties that\nappear to be new. We obtain general procedures to sample the first passage\nevent of a subordinator across a regular non-increasing boundary, and that of a\nprocess with infinite Levy measure, bounded variation, and suitable drift\nacross a constant level or interval. We give examples of application to a\nrather wide variety of Levy measures.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [1910010, 23419825, 46652885, 38340258, 23633818, 47702550, 215446267, 45889256, 24374510, 46507962], "authors": ["Zhiyi Chi"], "title": "On exact sampling of the first passage event of Levy process with\ninfinite Levy measure and bounded variation"}
