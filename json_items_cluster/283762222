{"id": 283762222, "abstract": "A method for large scale Gaussian process classification has been recently\nproposed based on expectation propagation (EP). Such a method allows Gaussian\nprocess classifiers to be trained on very large datasets that were out of the\nreach of previous deployments of EP and has been shown to be competitive with\nrelated techniques based on stochastic variational inference. Nevertheless, the\nmemory resources required scale linearly with the dataset size, unlike in\nvariational methods. This is a severe limitation when the number of instances\nis very large. Here we show that this problem is avoided when stochastic EP is\nused to train the model.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [41781800, 247598156, 220320048, 234108836, 280104533, 215721589, 228092206, 221618825, 268079368, 221617969], "authors": ["Daniel Hernández-Lobato", "José Miguel Hernández-Lobato", "Yingzhen Li", "Thang Bui", "Richard E.
