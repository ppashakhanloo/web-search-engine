{"id": 228373683, "abstract": "We describe a flexible nonparametric approach to latent variable modelling in which the number of latent variables is unbounded. This approach is based on a probability distribution over equivalence classes of binary matrices with a finite number of rows, corresponding to the data points, and an unbounded number of columns, corresponding to the latent variables. Each data point can be associated with a subset of the possible latent variables, which we re-fer to as the latent features of that data point. The binary variables in the matrix indicate which latent feature is possessed by which data point, and there is a potentially infinite array of features. We derive the distribution over unbounded binary matrices by taking the limit of a distribution over N × K binary matrices as K → ∞. We define a simple generative processes for this distribution which we call the Indian buffet process (IBP; Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2005, 2006) by analogy to the Chinese restaurant process (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002). The IBP has a single hyperparameter which controls both the number of feature per object and the total number of fea-tures. We describe a two-parameter generalization of the IBP which has addi-tional flexibility, independently controlling the number of features per object and the total number of features in the matrix. The use of this distribution as a prior in an infinite latent feature model is illustrated, and Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference are described.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [273398187, 268226636, 258657494, 230802730, 236645999, 221346491, 221346022, 220320251, 242092059, 45893028], "references": [220270203, 229100346, 42790702, 229100978, 2741222, 221346403, 228851557, 23951944, 228092026, 12752937], "authors": ["Zoubin Ghahramani", "Thomas L Griffiths", "Peter Sollich"], "title": "Bayesian nonparametric latent feature models"}
