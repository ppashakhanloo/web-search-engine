{"id": 240489008, "abstract": "The covariance and variogram models (ordinary or generalized) are\nimportant statistical tools used in various estimation and simulation\ntechniques which have been recently applied to diverse hydrologic\nproblems. For example, the efficacy of kriging, a method for\ninterpolating, filtering, or averaging spatial phenomena, depends, to a\nlarge extent, on the covariance or variogram model chosen. The aim of\nthis article is to provide the users of these techniques with convenient\ncriteria that may help them to judge whether a function which arises in\na particular problem, and is not included among the known covariance or\nvariogram models, is permissible as such a model. This is done by\ninvestigating the properties of the candidate model in both the space\nand frequency domains. In the present article this investigation covers\nstationary random functions as well as intrinsic random functions (i.e.,\nnonstationary functions for which increments of some order are\nstationary). Then, based on the theoretical results obtained, a\nprocedure is outlined and successfully applied to a number of candidate\nmodels. In order to give to this procedure a more practical context, we\nemploy \"stereological\" equations that essentially transfer the\ninvestigations to one-dimensional space, together with approximations in\nterms of polygonal functions and Fourier-Bessel series expansions. There\nare many benefits and applications of such a procedure. Polygonal models\ncan be fit arbitrarily closely to the data. Also, the approximation of a\nparticular model in the frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel series\nexpansion can be very effective. This is shown by theory and by example.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [274730196, 261404651, 258724504, 48419652, 238493174, 45909609, 222398213, 23649220, 227997599, 224314618], "references": [31321231, 239062652, 222746523, 248806866, 230837892, 31398319, 243099090, 288939892], "authors": ["George Christakos"], "title": "On the Problem of Permissible Covariance and Variogram Models"}
