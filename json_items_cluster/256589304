{"id": 256589304, "abstract": "An unsupervised track classification approach is applied to sonar multistatic multitarget tracking. Appropriate discriminative and aggregative features are derived from beamformed and normalized matched-filtered data as recorded from a linear array towed behind an AUV. A clustering algorithm based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes is proposed for unsupervised classification of tracks. Overall improvement of target tracking is demonstrated via the Optimal Subpattern Assignment metric.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [268503436], "references": [230705191, 3320950, 224980705, 50402324, 221620547, 4742259, 229100417, 230888378, 244954555, 221345210], "authors": ["J.
