{"id": 2984124, "abstract": "This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and\ngives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along\nwith a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct\nproblems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original\nsources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the\nbackground required to pursue further this area of research. The author\nfirst reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the\nconcept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic\nfunction of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is\nillustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the\nclassic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are\nnoted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are\ngiven. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including\nergodic as well as left-right models, are described", "cluster": "2", "citations": [266371416, 273836421, 279199113, 275642113, 277723770, 280613177, 280688538, 275836557, 280589906, 280497984], "references": [223651148, 224737115, 2997335, 224737782, 224737907, 224737993, 3082546, 3082597, 242584270, 3084297], "authors": ["L.R.
