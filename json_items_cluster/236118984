{"id": 236118984, "abstract": "We consider the question of Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling from a general\nstick-breaking Dirichlet process mixture model, with concentration parameter\nalpha. This paper introduces a Gibbs sampling algorithm that combines the slice\nsampling approach of Walker (2007) and the retrospective sampling approach of\nPapaspiliopoulos and Roberts (2008). Our general algorithm is implemented as\nefficient open source C++ software, available as an R package, and is based on\na blocking strategy similar to that suggested by Papaspiliopoulos (2008) and\nimplemented by Yau et al (2011).\nWe discuss the difficulties of achieving good mixing in MCMC samplers of this\nnature and investigate sensitivity to initialisation. We additionally consider\nthe challenges when an additional layer of hierarchy is added such that joint\ninference is to be made on alpha. We introduce a new label switching move and\ncompute the marginal model posterior to help to surmount these difficulties.\nOur work is illustrated using a profile regression (Molitor et al, 2010)\napplication, where we demonstrate good mixing behaviour for both synthetic and\nreal examples.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [235903559, 261915119, 272482980], "references": [235903559, 46565143, 236940827, 38327033, 2741222, 42638843, 230592817, 51528703, 258038241, 51233194], "authors": ["David I.
