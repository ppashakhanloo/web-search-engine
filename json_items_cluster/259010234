{"id": 259010234, "abstract": "Kernel methods have revolutionized the fields of pattern recognition and\nmachine learning. The importance of achieving a sound quantification of\nuncertainty in predictions by characterizing the posterior distribution over\nkernel parameters exactly has been demonstrated in several applications. This\npaper focuses on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based inference of covariance\n(kernel) parameters for Gaussian process classifiers. Recently, the\nexact-approximate MCMC approach has been proposed as a practical way to\nefficiently infer covariance parameters in Gaussian process classifiers\nexactly. In this approach, an unbiased estimate of the marginal likelihood\nobtained by importance sampling replaces the actual marginal likelihood in the\nHastings ratio. This paper presents the application of annealed importance\nsampling to obtain a low-variance unbiased estimate of the marginal likelihood.\nThis paper empirically demonstrates that annealed importance sampling reduces\nthe variance of the estimate of the marginal likelihood exponentially in the\nnumber of data compared to importance sampling, while the computational cost\nscales only polynomially. The results on real data demonstrate that employing\nannealed importance sampling in the exact-approximate MCMC approach represents\na step forward in the development of fully automated exact inference engines\nfor Gaussian process classifiers.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [260367062, 261637716, 262954130, 286227172], "references": [257299295, 221662690, 46537493, 2777175, 47327028, 239756954, 40498233, 31403274, 41781429, 4772221], "authors": ["Maurizio Filippone"], "title": "Bayesian Inference for Gaussian Process Classifiers with Annealing and Exact-Approximate MCMC"}
