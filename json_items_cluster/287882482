{"id": 287882482, "abstract": "To solve the problem of human behavior recognition, an approach based on improved R transform and discriminative random fields model is proposed; the improved R transform has the ability of scale invariance, the two-dimensional planar function does not need to be scale standardization when extracting the features, enhancing the features' robustness. The discriminative random fields improved the Hidden Conditional Random Fields' performance, this model got the behavior's internal dynamic characteristics and the external dynamic contacts. On the public human behavior database, by comparing the experimental results, it demonstrated that this method had better recognition results than the previous methods.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [289813837, 289850919, 240744821, 260353896], "authors": ["Z.
