{"id": 221664737, "abstract": "Probability measure P_n on the symmetric group S_n is said to be\nrecord-dependent if P_n(s) depends only on the set of records of permutation s.\nA sequence P=(P_n) of consistent record-dependent measures determines a random\norder on the set of positive integers. In this paper we describe the extreme\nelements of the convex set of such P. This problem turns out to be related to\nthe study of asymptotic behavior of permutation-valued growth processes, to\nrandom extensions of partial orders, and to the measures on the Young-Fibonacci\nlattice.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [], "references": [226660449, 231964169, 244454048, 250795974, 38351567, 222827004, 246299600, 250795971, 226138172, 23716904], "authors": ["Alexander Gnedin", "Vadim Gorin"], "title": "Record-dependent measures on the symmetric groups: Record-Dependent Measures"}
