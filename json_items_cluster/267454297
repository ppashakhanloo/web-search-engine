{"id": 267454297, "abstract": "Mean Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation\nmethod due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well\nknown that a major failing of MFVB is its (sometimes severe) underestimates of\nthe uncertainty of model variables and lack of information about model variable\ncovariance. We develop a fast, general methodology for exponential families\nthat augments MFVB to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model\nvariables -- both for individual variables and coherently across variables.\nMFVB for exponential families defines a fixed-point equation in the means of\nthe approximating posterior, and our approach yields a covariance estimate by\nperturbing this fixed point. Inspired by linear response theory, we call our\nmethod linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). We demonstrate the accuracy of\nour method on simulated data sets.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [262157385, 254212736, 228092206, 246452549, 221995544, 46537493, 255061313, 220500257, 7975586, 236853450], "authors": ["Ryan Giordano", "Tamara Broderick"], "title": "Covariance Matrices for Mean Field Variational Bayes"}
