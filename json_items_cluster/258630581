{"id": 258630581, "abstract": "The functional formof spillover,measured as a gradient of abundance of fish,may provide insight about processes\nthat control the spatial distribution of fish inside and outside theMPA. In this study,we aimed to infer on spillover\nmechanism of Diplodus spp. (family Sparidae) from a Mediterranean MPA (Carry-le-Rouet, France) from visual\ncensuses and artisanal fisheries data. From the existing literature, three potential functional forms of spillover\nsuch as a linear gradient, an exponential gradient and a logistic gradient are defined. Each functional form is included\nin a spatial generalized linear mixed model allowing accounting for spatial autocorrelation of data. We select\nbetween the different forms of gradients by using a Bayesian model selection procedure. In a first step, the functional\nform of the spillover for visual census and artisanal fishing data is assessed separately. For both sets of\ndata, ourmodel selection favoured the negative exponentialmodel, evidencing a decrease of the spatial abundance\nof fish vanishing around 1000 m from the MPA border. We combined both datasets in a joint model by including\nan observability parameter. This parameter captures how the different sources of data quantify the underlying spatial\ndistribution of the harvested species. This enabled us to demonstrate that the different sampling methods do\nnot affect the estimation of the underlying spatial distribution of Diplodus spp. inside and outside the MPA. We\nshow that data from different sources can be pooled through spatial generalized linear mixedmodel. Our findings\nallow to better understand the underlying mechanisms that control spillover of fish from MPA.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [281108254], "references": [227701452, 250217025, 44568962, 41532355, 222582536, 46092861, 226071827, 35382840, 227647478, 23481066], "authors": ["Edwige Bellier", "Neubaeur P", "Pascal Monestiez", "Yves Letourneur", "Laurence Ledireach", "Patrick Bonhomme", "Frederic Bachet"], "title": "Marine reserve spillover: Modelling from multiple data sources"}
