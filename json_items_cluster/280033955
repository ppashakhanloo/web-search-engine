{"id": 280033955, "abstract": "We propose a generic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to speed up\ncomputations for datasets with many observations. A key feature of our approach\nis the use of the highly efficient difference estimator from the survey\nsampling literature to estimate the log-likelihood accurately using only a\nsmall fraction of the data. Our algorithm improves on the $O(n)$ complexity of\nregular MCMC by operating over local data clusters instead of the full sample\nwhen computing the likelihood. The likelihood estimate is used in a\nPseudo-marginal framework to sample from a perturbed posterior which is within\n$O(m^{-1/2})$ of the true posterior, where $m$ is the subsample size. The\nmethod is applied to a logistic regression model to predict firm bankruptcy for\na large data set. We document a significant speed up in comparison to the\nstandard MCMC on the full dataset.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [239578406, 232062873, 236235190, 261065671, 265907991, 258631741, 257146976, 46154966, 44816799, 257142847], "authors": ["Matias Quiroz", "Mattias Villani", "Robert Kohn"], "title": "Scalable MCMC for Large Data Problems using Data Subsampling and the Difference Estimator"}
