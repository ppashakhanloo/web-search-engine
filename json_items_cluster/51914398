{"id": 51914398, "abstract": "Inductive learning is based on inferring a general rule from a finite data\nset and using it to label new data. In transduction one attempts to solve the\nproblem of using a labeled training set to label a set of unlabeled points,\nwhich are given to the learner prior to learning. Although transduction seems\nat the outset to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many\nprovably useful algorithms for transduction. Moreover, the precise relation\nbetween induction and transduction has not yet been determined. The main\ntheoretical developments related to transduction were presented by Vapnik more\nthan twenty years ago. One of Vapnik's basic results is a rather tight error\nbound for transductive classification based on an exact computation of the\nhypergeometric tail. While tight, this bound is given implicitly via a\ncomputational routine. Our first contribution is a somewhat looser but explicit\ncharacterization of a slightly extended PAC-Bayesian version of Vapnik's\ntransductive bound. This characterization is obtained using concentration\ninequalities for the tail of sums of random variables obtained by sampling\nwithout replacement. We then derive error bounds for compression schemes such\nas (transductive) support vector machines and for transduction algorithms based\non clustering. The main observation used for deriving these new error bounds\nand algorithms is that the unlabeled test points, which in the transductive\nsetting are known in advance, can be used in order to construct useful data\ndependent prior distributions over the hypothesis space.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [281337743, 264832488, 269988198, 221165959, 221618717, 221632199, 220319991, 221345718, 221012918, 268056004], "references": [2371584, 233971671, 38351791, 2625016, 221346470, 221497453, 2458828, 45622657, 2573396, 2893638], "authors": ["Philip Derbeko", "Ran El-yaniv", "Ron Meir"], "title": "Explicit Learning Curves for Transduction and Application to Clustering\nand Compression Algorithms"}
