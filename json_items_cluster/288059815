{"id": 288059815, "abstract": "In this paper we develop a method for the nonlinear filtering of dynamic\npopulation codes with unknown latent dynamics. This method is based on a\nparameterized function which updates beliefs while keeping the dimension of the\nbelief space constant. In order to optimize this function, we construct a\ngraphical model representation of the belief-latent state dynamics, and show\nthat a certain marginalization of the graphical model has the form of a\nconditional exponential family harmonium. This marginalization allows us to\nmaximize the likelihood of observations, and thereby optimize the parameterized\nfunction, by the method of contrastive divergence minimization. By defining the\nparameterized function as a multilayer perceptron, we show how the stochastic\ncontrastive divergence gradient may be computed with backpropagation. We\nconclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on a filtering\nproblem based on a stochastic pendulum.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [235409843, 264559133, 23706599, 5920306, 51749628, 23482807, 272422911, 246035131, 40683630, 3022962], "authors": ["Sacha Sokoloski"], "title": "Nonlinear Filtering with Population Codes"}
