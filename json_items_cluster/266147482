{"id": 266147482, "abstract": "The problem of software artifact retrieval has the goal to effectively locate\nsoftware artifacts, such as a piece of source code, in a large code repository.\nThis problem has been traditionally addressed through the textual query. In\nother words, information retrieval techniques will be exploited based on the\ntextual similarity between queries and textual representation of software\nartifacts, which is generated by collecting words from comments, identifiers,\nand descriptions of programs. However, in addition to these semantic\ninformation, there are rich information embedded in source codes themselves.\nThese source codes, if analyzed properly, can be a rich source for enhancing\nthe efforts of software artifact retrieval. To this end, in this paper, we\ndevelop a feature extraction method on source codes. Specifically, this method\ncan capture both the inherent information in the source codes and the semantic\ninformation hidden in the comments, descriptions, and identifiers of the source\ncodes. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous metric learning approach, which\nallows to integrate code features and text features into the same latent\nsemantic space. This, in turn, can help to measure the artifact similarity by\nexploiting the joint power of both code and text features. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on real-world data show that the proposed method can help to\nimprove the performances of software artifact retrieval with a significant\nmargin.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [200111054, 2832818, 215739362, 2480258, 4016662, 221497344, 267375183, 2939839, 221618254, 221345438], "authors": ["Liang Wu", "Hui Xiong", "Liang Du", "Bo Liu", "Guandong Xu", "Yong Ge", "Yanjie Fu", "Yuanchun Zhou", "Jianhui Li"], "title": "Heterogeneous Metric Learning with Content-Based Regularization for Software Artifact Retrieval"}
