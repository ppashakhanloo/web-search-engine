{"id": 220949396, "abstract": "Summary form only given. Parallel genetic algorithm for search and constrained multiobjective optimization introduces the design and complexity analysis of a parallel genetic algorithm to generate a \"best\" path for a robot arm to follow, given a starting position and a goal in three dimensional space. Path generation takes into account any obstacles near the arm. This algorithm uses multiple optimization criteria, independent cross-pollinating populations, and handles multiple hard constraints. Individuals in the population consist of multiple chromosomes. The complexity of the algorithm is the number of generations processed times O(N ) where N is the total number of individuals used for path generation on all of the optimizations.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [220180305, 222534332, 251988411, 220479978, 265125216, 258083640], "references": [220742835, 2718690, 30870312, 220885629, 246307253, 220045412, 220701837, 216300535, 264923669], "authors": ["Lucas A.
