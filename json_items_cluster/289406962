{"id": 289406962, "abstract": "In our work, we propose a novel formulation for supervised dimensionality\nreduction based on a nonlinear dependency criterion called Statistical Distance\nCorrelation, Szekely et. al. (2007). We propose an objective which is free of\ndistributional assumptions on regression variables and regression model\nassumptions. Our proposed formulation is based on learning a low-dimensional\nfeature representation $\\mathbf{z}$, which maximizes the squared sum of\nDistance Correlations between low dimensional features $\\mathbf{z}$ and\nresponse $y$, and also between features $\\mathbf{z}$ and covariates\n$\\mathbf{x}$. We propose a novel algorithm to optimize our proposed objective\nusing the Generalized Minimization Maximizaiton method of \\Parizi et. al.\n(2015). We show superior empirical results on multiple datasets proving the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach over several relevant state-of-the-art\nsupervised dimensionality reduction methods.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [2433873, 230221658, 228481562, 238046447, 227369125, 227443128, 263679123, 4974606, 216027470, 271649222], "authors": ["Praneeth Vepakomma", "Chetan Tonde", "Ahmed Elgammal"], "title": "Supervised Dimensionality Reduction via Distance Correlation Maximization"}
