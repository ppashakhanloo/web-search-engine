{"id": 3807947, "abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of sequential Bayesian model\nselection. This problem does not usually admit any closed-form\nanalytical solution. We propose here an original sequential\nsimulation-based method to solve the associated Bayesian computational\nproblems. This method combines sequential importance sampling, a\nresampling procedure and reversible jump MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo)\nmoves. We describe a generic algorithm and then apply it to the problem\nof sequential Bayesian model order estimation of autoregressive (AR)\ntime series observed in additive noise", "cluster": "5", "citations": [234140100, 225549514, 224560992, 3320952, 221362878, 224641446, 4217606, 228966875, 3318657, 4015029], "references": [2590205, 3361206, 4772026, 2796321, 38357609, 3316982, 38357612, 222838919, 261593363, 4895745], "authors": ["Christophe Andrieu", "Nando De Freitas", "Arnaud Doucet"], "title": "Sequential MCMC for Bayesian model selection"}
