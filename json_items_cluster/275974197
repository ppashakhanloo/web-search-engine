We present a simple algorithm that is provably\ndifferentially private, while offering good performance, using a novel\nconnection of differential privacy to Bayesian posterior sampling via\nStochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Due to its simplicity the algorithm\nlends itself to efficient implementation. By careful systems design and by\nexploiting the power law behavior of the data to maximize CPU cache bandwidth\nwe are able to generate 1024 dimensional models at a rate of 8.5 million\nrecommendations per second on a single PC.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [221520030, 228095582, 273157486, 260232379, 237053943, 269692923, 225451636, 225124717, 45856159, 220424836], "authors": ["Ziqi Liu", "Yu-Xiang Wang", "Alexander J.
