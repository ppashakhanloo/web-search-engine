{"id": 236736791, "abstract": "Let $M(x)$ denote the expected value at level $x$ of the response to a certain experiment. $M(x)$ is assumed to be a monotone function of $x$ but is unknown to the experimenter, and it is desired to find the solution $x = \\theta$ of the equation $M(x) = \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a given constant. We give a method for making successive experiments at levels $x_1,x_2,\\cdots$ in such a way that $x_n$ will tend to $\\theta$ in probability.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [289587906, 288890389, 287643037, 287643496, 285648257, 283117657, 282639340, 283010994, 271820981, 280912215], "references": [], "authors": ["Herbert Robbins", "Sutton Monro"], "title": "A Stochastic Approximation Method"}
