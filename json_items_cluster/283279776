{"id": 283279776, "abstract": "We study random families of subsets of $\\mathbb{N}$ that are similar to\nexchangeable random partitions, but do not require constituent sets to be\ndisjoint: Each element of ${\\mathbb{N}}$ may be contained in multiple subsets.\nOne class of such objects, known as Indian buffet processes, has become a\npopular tool in machine learning. Based on an equivalence between Indian buffet\nand scale-invariant Poisson processes, we identify a random scaling variable\nwhose role is similar to that played in exchangeable partition models by the\ntotal mass of a random measure. Analogous to the construction of exchangeable\npartitions from normalized subordinators, random families of sets can be\nconstructed from randomly scaled subordinators. Coupling to a heavy-tailed\nscaling variable induces a power law on the number of sets containing the first\n$n$ elements. Several examples, with properties desirable in applications, are\nderived explicitly. A relationship to exchangeable partitions is made precise\nas a correspondence between scaled subordinators and Poisson-Kingman measures,\ngeneralizing a result of Arratia, Barbour and Tavare on scale-invariant\nprocesses.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [265543899, 220270203, 265357735, 24163428, 221619128, 5323469, 3321006, 223803147, 2826951, 220270095], "authors": ["Lancelot F.
