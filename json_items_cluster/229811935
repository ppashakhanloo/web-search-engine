{"id": 229811935, "abstract": "In this appendix\n\nwe describe asymptotic expansion methods which have been developed and applied in the study of electron, positron and multiphoton\ncollision processes. We consider first asymptotic expansion solutions of the coupled second-order differential equations which\narise in the study of electron and positron collisions with atoms, ions and molecules. We then consider asymptotic expansion \nsolutions of the coupled second-order differential equations which arise in R-matrix–Floquet theory of multiphoton ionization and laser-assisted electron–atom and electron–ion collisions when the velocity\ngauge\n\nis adopted in the asymptotic region.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [266148624, 264915564, 262560562, 263164485, 261222191, 259151517, 261297668, 223130147, 263802948, 224260418], "references": [265441780, 255893432], "authors": ["E.
