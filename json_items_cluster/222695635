{"id": 222695635, "abstract": "A conventional neural network approach to regression problems approximates the conditional mean of the output vector. For mappings which are multi-valued this approach breaks down, since the average of two solutions is not necessarily a valid solution. In this article mixture density networks, a principled method for modelling conditional probability density functions, are applied to retrieving Cartesian wind vector components from satellite scatterometer data. A hybrid mixture density network is implemented to incorporate prior knowledge of the predominantly bimodal function branches. An advantage of a fully probabilistic model is that more sophisticated and principled methods can be used to resolve ambiguities.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [227606382, 222536347, 40498303, 43798224, 40498309, 228783341, 33776225, 220550771, 40498250, 40498273], "references": [229100226, 3490776, 215722315, 215722314, 248794518, 3625294, 222548306, 40498323, 248798881, 222555704], "authors": ["David J.
