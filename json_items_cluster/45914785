{"id": 45914785, "abstract": "In this paper we consider sparse and identifiable linear latent variable\n(factor) and linear Bayesian network models for parsimonious analysis of\nmultivariate data. We propose a computationally efficient method for joint\nparameter and model inference, and model comparison. It consists of a fully\nBayesian hierarchy for sparse models using slab and spike priors (two-component\ndelta-function and continuous mixtures), non-Gaussian latent factors and a\nstochastic search over the ordering of the variables. The framework, which we\ncall SLIM (Sparse Linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling), is validated and\nbench-marked on artificial and real biological data sets. SLIM is closest in\nspirit to LiNGAM (Shimizu et al., 2006), but differs substantially in\ninference, Bayesian network structure learning and model comparison.\nExperimentally, SLIM performs equally well or better than LiNGAM with\ncomparable computational complexity. We attribute this mainly to the stochastic\nsearch strategy used, and to parsimony (sparsity and identifiability), which is\nan explicit part of the model. We propose two extensions to the basic i.i.d.\nlinear framework: non-linear dependence on observed variables, called SNIM\n(Sparse Non-linear Identifiable Multivariate modeling) and allowing for\ncorrelations between latent variables, called CSLIM (Correlated SLIM), for the\ntemporal and/or spatial data.
