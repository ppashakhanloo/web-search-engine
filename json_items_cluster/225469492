{"id": 225469492, "abstract": "Although importance sampling is an established and effective sampling and estimation technique, it becomes unstable and unreliable\nfor high-dimensional problems. The main reason is that the likelihood ratio in the importance sampling estimator degenerates\nwhen the dimension of the problem becomes large. Various remedies to this problem have been suggested, including heuristics\nsuch as resampling. Even so, the consensus is that for large-dimensional problems, likelihood ratios (and hence importance\nsampling) should be avoided. In this paper we introduce a new adaptive simulation approach that does away with likelihood\nratios, while retaining the multi-level approach of the cross-entropy method. Like the latter, the method can be used for\nrare-event probability estimation, optimization, and counting. Moreover, the method allows one to sample exactly from the\ntarget distribution rather than asymptotically as in Markov chain Monte Carlo. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the method for a variety of applications.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [280310254, 265127940, 258082621, 226031060, 220399354, 233065791, 51892081, 220538627, 45895681, 224366100], "references": [225551595, 225304570, 220345500, 210222819, 242386046, 224839810, 37621654, 41222435, 200744518, 225579612], "authors": ["Zdravko I.
