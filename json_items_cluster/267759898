{"id": 267759898, "abstract": "Network reconciliation is the problem of identifying nodes in separate\nnetworks that represent the same entity, for example matching nodes across\nsocial networks that correspond to the same user. We introduce a technique to\ncompute probably approximately correct (PAC) bounds on precision and recall for\nnetwork reconciliation algorithms. The bounds require some verified matches,\nbut those matches may be used to develop the algorithms. The bounds do not\nrequire knowledge of the network generation process, and they can supply\nconfidence levels for individual matches.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [], "references": [271554241, 246546930, 228057769, 38015401, 247093571, 239546749, 3770656, 2860041, 267128815, 264954908], "authors": ["Ya Le", "Eric Bax", "Nicola Barbieri", "David Garcia Soriano", "Jitesh Mehta", "James Li"], "title": "Validation of Network Reconciliation"}
