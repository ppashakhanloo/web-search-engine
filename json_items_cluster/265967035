{"id": 265967035, "abstract": "We study the best-arm identification problem in linear bandit, where the\nrewards of the arms depend linearly on an unknown parameter $\\theta^*$ and the\nobjective is to return the arm with the largest reward. We characterize the\ncomplexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull\narms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the\nsample budget. In particular, we show the importance of exploiting the global\nlinear structure to improve the estimate of the reward of near-optimal arms. We\nanalyze the proposed strategies and compare their empirical performance.\nFinally, we point out the connection to the $G$-optimality criterion used in\noptimal experimental design.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [279175822, 289952125], "references": [230627940, 221497549, 220320299, 221394179, 224959372, 234061312, 234061317, 230873063, 45903533, 230997606], "authors": ["Marta Soare", "Alessandro Lazaric", "RÃ©mi Munos"], "title": "Best-Arm Identification in Linear Bandits"}
