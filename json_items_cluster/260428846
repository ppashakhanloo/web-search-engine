{"id": 260428846, "abstract": "Patients with epilepsy can manifest short, sub-clinical epileptic \"bursts\" in\naddition to full-blown clinical seizures. We believe the relationship between\nthese two classes of events---something not previously studied\nquantitatively---could yield important insights into the nature and intrinsic\ndynamics of seizures. A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic\nevents into distinct dynamic regimes. A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG\n(iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes\ncan vary between patients. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching\nprocess that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers\nof channels, (ii) asynchronous regime-switching, and (iii) an unknown\ndictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of\ndependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical\nmodel for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics and demonstrate\nthe importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG\ndata. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help\nautomate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of\nsub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [281143829, 284729742], "references": [265617070, 220320063, 224056058, 220321339, 2348531, 44024149, 236157548, 45851769, 221620193, 8012478], "authors": ["Drausin F.
