{"id": 259151452, "abstract": "Sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs), that is multivariate\nGaussian ran- dom vectors that are parameterised by the inverse of their\ncovariance matrix, is a fundamental problem in computational statistics. In\nthis paper, we show how we can exploit arbitrarily accu- rate approximations to\na GMRF to speed up Krylov subspace sampling methods. We also show that these\nmethods can be used when computing the normalising constant of a large\nmultivariate Gaussian distribution, which is needed for both any\nlikelihood-based inference method. The method we derive is also applicable to\nother structured Gaussian random vectors and, in particu- lar, we show that\nwhen the precision matrix is a perturbation of a (block) circulant matrix, it\nis still possible to derive O(n log n) sampling schemes.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [271218362], "references": [225081349, 230872767, 225359686, 257618460, 227375782, 227423874, 41016722, 227701452, 243668757, 221661751], "authors": ["Daniel P.
