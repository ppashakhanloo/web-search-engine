{"id": 258373922, "abstract": "Missing value imputation is an important practical problem. There is a large\nbody of work on it, but there does not exist any work that formulates the\nproblem in a structured output setting. Also, most applications have\nconstraints on the imputed data, for example on the distribution associated\nwith each variable. None of the existing imputation methods use these\nconstraints. In this paper we propose a structured output approach for missing\nvalue imputation that also incorporates domain constraints. We focus on large\nmargin models, but it is easy to extend the ideas to probabilistic models. We\ndeal with the intractable inference step in learning via a piecewise training\ntechnique that is simple, efficient, and effective. Comparison with existing\nstate-of-the-art and baseline imputation methods shows that our method gives\nsignificantly improved performance on the Hamming loss measure.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [228988240, 13094429, 238625098, 244959137, 3085610, 221653418, 4324233, 220056262, 2371584, 220320702], "authors": ["Rahul Kidambi", "Vinod Nair", "Sundararajan Sellamanickam", "S.
