The Indian\nBuffet Process (IBP) is used as a prior on $\\mathbf{G}$ to incorporate sparsity\nand to allow the number of latent features to be inferred. The model's utility\nfor modeling gene expression data is investigated using randomly generated data\nsets based on a known sparse connectivity matrix for E.
