{"id": 2570964, "abstract": "In recent years, a gradual increase in the sophistication of multiobjective evolutionary algo- rithms (MOEAs) for Pareto optimization has been seen, accompanied by an ever-growing list of applications. Despite this trend, however, the proposition that methods based on local search may be a good alternative approach -- with the advantages of ease-of-use and lower computational overhead -- has not been thoroughly tested. In this thesis we develop a novel, local-sear& algorithm for Pareto optimization, called PAES, enabling us to test and compare MOEAs against this philosophically different search method.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [271445970, 261120557, 225563839, 44685406, 47394396, 220741273, 224579855, 47843204, 47843222, 23647254], "references": [23740136, 220800153, 2280242, 35578608, 216300535, 216300639, 2690834, 225510861, 216300933, 220471363], "authors": ["Joshua D.
