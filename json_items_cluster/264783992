{"id": 264783992, "abstract": "Sign language recognition is an important topic of current research in today's\nscenario. The systems developed till now worldwide in this area are under\nscanner for standardization. But, the situation of automatic gesture recognition\nof Indian Sign Language is in its early stage. So, the focus of this research is to\ndevelop an automatic gesture recognition system for Indian Sign Language. In\nthis paper, the focus is on the dataset development, application of various\nfeature extraction methods in combination with skin colour detection and\nanalysis of results of k-Nearest Neighbor and Neural Network classifiers in\nspecific words belongs to computer terminologies of Indian Sign Language.\nThe skin colour detection method helps us to extract hand and face portions of\nimages from input video frames. This ignores other components available in\nimage frames, like body parts and image background, which are not desired\nfeatures for the classification. The best results obtained from k-Nearest\nNeighbor classifier is 97.04% with image pixel feature extraction method. An\naccuracy rate of 97.00% obtained in combination of image pixel feature\nextraction method and Neural Network classifier.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [216679417, 235766181, 221296006, 263506784, 225797350, 262187093, 239056767, 248391121, 223519735, 259507458], "authors": ["Ashok Sahoo", "Kiran Kumar Ravulakollu"], "title": "Indian Sign Language Recognition using Skin Colour Detection"}
