{"id": 230786935, "abstract": "Clustering is a key component in any data analysis toolbox. Despite its importance, scalable algorithms often eschew rich statistical models in favor of simpler descriptions such as k-means clustering. In this paper we present a sampler, capable of estimating mixtures of exponential families. At its heart lies a novel proposal distribution using random projections to achieve high throughput in generating proposals, which is crucial for clustering models with large numbers of clusters.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [51956848], "references": [215991424, 220416605, 5948829, 228095627, 200110604, 2928129, 221591327, 221023652, 2457699, 236736810], "authors": ["Amr Ahmed", "Sujith Ravi", "Shravan Narayanamurthy", "Alex Smola"], "title": "FastEx: Fast Clustering with Exponential Families"}
