{"id": 221618091, "abstract": "We propose probabilistic generative models, called parametric mix- ture models (PMMs), for multiclass, multi-labeled text categoriza- tion problem. Conventionally, the binary classication approach has been employed, in which whether or not text belongs to a cat- egory is judged by the binary classier for every category. In con- trast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive ecien t learning and prediction algo- rithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signican tly outperform the conventional binary methods when ap- plied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [282938718, 270337594, 272566091, 269097117, 263813673, 257947469, 262358547, 276197880, 220517212, 221659317], "references": [215721756, 221613897, 2249086, 2379828, 45622657, 2454668, 221995817, 226507886, 220319974], "authors": ["Naonori Ueda", "Kazumi Saito"], "title": "Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text."}
