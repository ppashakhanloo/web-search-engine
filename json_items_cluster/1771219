{"id": 1771219, "abstract": "In this paper, we shall optimize the efficiency of Metropolis algorithms for multidimensional target distributions with scaling terms possibly depending on the dimension. We propose a method for determining the appropriate form for the scaling of the proposal distribution as a function of the dimension, which leads to the proof of an asymptotic diffusion theorem. We show that when there does not exist any component with a scaling term significantly smaller than the others, the asymptotically optimal acceptance rate is the well-known 0.234.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [275897326, 245025933, 233967527, 232718818, 232276216, 229316328, 251211218, 50425579, 48198752, 45895665], "references": [38363050, 235726242, 38326865, 4771819, 2111878, 227672958, 2113732, 2834582, 236157562, 31403274], "authors": ["Mylène Bédard"], "title": "Bédard, M.: Weak convergence of metropolis algorithms for non-i.i.d. target distributions.
