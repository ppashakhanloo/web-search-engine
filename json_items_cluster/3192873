{"id": 3192873, "abstract": "We present a novel optimization framework for unsupervised texture\nsegmentation that relies on statistical tests as a measure of\nhomogeneity. Texture segmentation is formulated as a data clustering\nproblem based on sparse proximity data. Dissimilarities of pairs of\ntextured regions are computed from a multiscale Gabor filter image\nrepresentation. We discuss and compare a class of clustering objective\nfunctions which is systematically derived from invariance principles. As\na general optimization framework, we propose deterministic annealing\nbased on a mean-field approximation. The canonical way to derive\nclustering algorithms within this framework as well as an efficient\nimplementation of mean-field annealing and the closely related Gibbs\nsampler are presented. We apply both annealing variants to Brodatz-like\nmicrotexture mixtures and real-word images", "cluster": "0", "citations": [248385162, 220600354, 264018561, 224240216, 285176335, 50291470, 234066123, 265163318, 264136038, 221111933], "references": [220270074, 220680181, 2460430, 19140456, 2461298, 3191646, 3301752, 3192192, 13254310, 3703241], "authors": ["Thomas Hofmann", "Jan Puzicha", "Joachim M.
