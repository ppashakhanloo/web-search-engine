{"id": 3193107, "abstract": "We present a variational model devoted to image classification\ncoupled with an edge-preserving regularization process. The discrete\nnature of classification (i.e., to attribute a label to each pixel) has\nled to the development of many probabilistic image classification\nmodels, but rarely to variational ones. In the last decade, the\nvariational approach has proven its efficiency in the field of\nedge-preserving restoration. We add a classification capability which\ncontributes to provide images composed of homogeneous regions with\nregularized boundaries, a region being defined as a set of pixels\nbelonging to the same class. The soundness of our model is based on the\nworks developed on the phase transition theory in mechanics. The\nproposed algorithm is fast, easy to implement, and efficient. We compare\nour results on both synthetic and satellite images with the ones\nobtained by a stochastic model using a Potts regularization", "cluster": "0", "citations": [260194508, 51075619, 224169952, 41056014, 232769343, 43293821, 3328985, 224300152, 5755674, 6336337], "references": [5560147, 3220178, 5569128, 5583590, 225214382, 243655500, 5576290, 236268217, 226211637, 3191690], "authors": ["Christophe Samson", "Laure Blanc-Feraud", "Gilles Aubert", "Josiane Zerubia"], "title": "A variational model for image classification and restoration"}
