{"id": 30975436, "abstract": "SUMMARY In clinical trials with sequential patient entry, fixed sample size designs are unjustified on ethical grounds and sequential\ndesigns are often impracticable. One solution is a group sequential design dividing patient entry into a number of equal-sized\ngroups so that the decision to stop the trial or continue is based on repeated significance tests of the accumulated data\nafter each group is evaluated. Exact results are obtained for a trial with two treatments and a normal response with known\nvariance. The design problem of determining the required size and number of groups is also considered. Simulation shows that\nthese normal results may be adapted to other types of response data. An example shows that group sequential designs can sometimes\nbe statistically superior to standard sequential designs.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [283512208, 272098264, 271668759, 265645016, 261369656, 267331634, 286827814, 262342836, 255974645, 236235190], "references": [18567420, 216301101, 216300067], "authors": ["Stuart J.
