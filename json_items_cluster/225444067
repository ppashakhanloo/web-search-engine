{"id": 225444067, "abstract": "We study the problem of classifying images into a given, pre-determined taxonomy. This task can be elegantly translated into\nthe structured learning framework. However, despite its power, structured learning has known limits in scalability due to\nits high memory requirements and slow training process. We propose an efficient approximation of the structured learning approach\nby an ensemble of local support vector machines (SVMs) that can be trained efficiently with standard techniques. Afirst theoretical\ndiscussion and experiments on toy-data allow to shed light onto why taxonomy-based classification can outperform taxonomy-free\napproaches and why an appropriately combined ensemble of local SVMs might be of high practical use. Further empirical results\non subsets of Caltech256 and VOC2006 data indeed show that our local SVM formulation can effectively exploit the taxonomy\nstructure and thus outperforms standard multi-class classification algorithms while it achieves on par results with taxonomy-based\nstructured algorithms at a significantly decreased computing time.\n\nKeywordsMulti-class object categorization–Taxonomies–Support vector machine–Structure learning", "cluster": "0", "citations": [280063899, 274095302, 267958868, 220728885, 227943276, 230769701, 227943275, 262254931, 257484790, 278797822], "references": [220320388, 41782196, 50252509, 2832818, 3193201, 228723345, 221573872, 221304850, 5608575, 224577638], "authors": ["Alexander Binder", "Klaus-Robert Müller", "Motoaki Kawanabe"], "title": "On Taxonomies for Multi-class Image Categorization"}
