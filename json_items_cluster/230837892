{"id": 230837892, "abstract": "The intrinsic random functions (IRF) are a particular case of the Guelfand generalized processes with stationary increments. They constitute a much wider class than the stationary RF, and are used in practical applications for representing non-stationary phenomena. The most important topics considered are: existence of a generalized covariance (GC) for which statistical inference is possible from a unique realization; theory of the best linear intrinsic estimator (BLIE) used for contouring and estimating problems; the turning bands method for simulating IRF; and the models with polynomial GC, for which statistical inference may be performed by automatic procedures.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [282898750, 284698663, 282850545, 282836851, 282563203, 282627791, 279310438, 273770019, 273773652, 272743718], "references": [269681721, 228057717, 240338872, 243782736, 230837892, 230837892, 230837892, 230837892, 230837892, 230837892], "authors": ["Georges Matheron"], "title": "The Intrinsic Random Functions and Their Applications"}
