{"id": 268747974, "abstract": "Explosive growth in data and availability of cheap computing resources have\nsparked increasing interest in Big learning, an emerging subfield that studies\nscalable machine learning algorithms, systems, and applications with Big Data.\nBayesian methods represent one important class of statistic methods for machine\nlearning, with substantial recent developments on adaptive, flexible and\nscalable Bayesian learning. This article provides a survey of the recent\nadvances in Big learning with Bayesian methods, termed Big Bayesian Learning,\nincluding nonparametric Bayesian methods for adaptively inferring model\ncomplexity, regularized Bayesian inference for improving the flexibility via\nposterior regularization, and scalable algorithms and systems based on\nstochastic subsampling and distributed computing for dealing with large-scale\napplications.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [274645123], "references": [45893028, 221520030, 228095582, 229099731, 6208117, 2433873, 227522317, 227276601, 261217260, 35752214], "authors": ["Jun Zhu", "Jianfei Chen", "Wenbo Hu"], "title": "Big Learning with Bayesian Methods"}
