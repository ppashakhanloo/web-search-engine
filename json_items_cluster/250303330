{"id": 250303330, "abstract": "The problem of inferring the population structure, linkage disequilibrium pattern, and\nchromosomal recombination hotspots from genetic polymorphism data is essential for\nunderstanding the origin and characteristics of genome variations, with important\napplications to the genetic analysis of disease propensities and other complex traits.\nStatistical genetic methodologies developed so far mostly address these problems\nseparately using specialized models ranging from coalescence and admixture models for\npopulation structures, to hidden Markov models and renewal processes for recombination;\nbut most of these approaches ignore the inherent uncertainty in the genetic complexity\n(e.g., the number of genetic founders of a population) of the data and the close\nstatistical and biological relationships among objects studied in these problems. We\npresent a new statistical framework called hidden Markov Dirichlet process (HMDP) to\njointly model the genetic recombinations among a possibly infinite number of founders and\nthe coalescence-with-mutation events in the resulting genealogies. The HMDP posits that a\nhaplotype of genetic markers is generated by a sequence of recombination events that\nselect an ancestor for each locus from an unbounded set of founders according to a\n1st-order Markov transition process. Conjoining this process with a mutation model, our\nmethod accommodates both between-lineage recombination and within-lineage sequence\nvariations, and leads to a compact and natural interpretation of the population structure \nand inheritance process underlying haplotype data. We have developed an efficient sampling\nalgorithm for HMDP based on a two-level nested PÃ³lya urn scheme, and we present\nexperimental results on joint inference of population structure, linkage disequilibrium,\nand recombination hotspots based on HMDP. On both simulated and real SNP haplotype data,\nour method performs competitively or significantly better than extant methods in\nuncovering the recombination hotspots along chromosomal loci; and in addition it also\ninfers the ancestral genetic patterns and offers a highly accurate map of ancestral\ncompositions of modern populations.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [45851769, 221344933, 240739390, 228586611, 6192977, 258229163, 23709411, 251651135, 44024149, 47622131], "references": [229100346, 229100417, 10980474, 27290603, 11340791, 2741222, 2882025, 11763944, 11615869, 7516123], "authors": ["Eric P.
