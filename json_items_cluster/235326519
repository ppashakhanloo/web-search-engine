{"id": 235326519, "abstract": "The problem of inferring a clustering of a data set has been the subject of\nmuch research in Bayesian analysis, and there currently exists a solid\nmathematical foundation for Bayesian approaches to clustering. In particular,\nthe class of probability distributions over partitions of a data set has been\ncharacterized in a number of ways, including via exchangeable partition\nprobability functions (EPPFs) and the Kingman paintbox. Here, we develop a\ngeneralization of the clustering problem, called feature allocation, where we\nallow each data point to belong to an arbitrary, non-negative integer number of\ngroups, now called features or topics. We define and study an \"exchangeable\nfeature probability function\" (EFPF)---analogous to the EPPF in the clustering\nsetting---for certain types of feature models. Moreover, we introduce a\n\"feature paintbox\" characterization---analogous to the Kingman paintbox for\nclustering---of the class of exchangeable feature models. We provide a further\ncharacterization of the subclass of feature allocations that have EFPF\nrepresentations.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [268226797, 267099477, 257299007, 233866228, 256199851, 259483495, 270454645, 279459225, 281808790], "references": [228060093, 51955773, 243766298, 51936102, 226138172, 247689715, 238684341, 243786155, 266430984, 228718793], "authors": ["Tamara Broderick", "Jim Pitman", "Michael I.
