{"id": 221345676, "abstract": "Bayesian network classiflers have been widely used for classiflcation problems. Given a flxed Bayesian network structure, pa- rameters learning can take two difierent approaches: generative and discriminative learning. While generative parameter learn- ing is more e-cient, discriminative param- eter learning is more efiective. In this pa- per, we propose a simple, e-cient, and efiective discriminative parameter learning method, called Discriminative Frequency Es- timate (DFE), which learns parameters by discriminatively computing frequencies from data. Empirical studies show that the DFE algorithm integrates the advantages of both generative and discriminative learning: it performs as well as the state-of-the-art dis- criminative parameter learning method ELR in accuracy, but is signiflcantly more e-cient.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [260556977, 271496622, 255482730, 45507591, 268009492, 228084546, 221442270, 226926725, 224088137, 224088060], "references": [255403555, 251458649, 220269296, 2423894, 226884574, 216301244, 220049129, 220343576, 2539230, 221603330], "authors": ["Jiang Su", "Harry Zhang", "Charles X.
