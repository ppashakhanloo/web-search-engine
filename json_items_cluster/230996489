{"id": 230996489, "abstract": "Super-resolution methods form high-resolution images from low-resolution\nimages. In this paper, we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model for\nsuper-resolution. Our method uses a beta-Bernoulli process to learn a set of\nrecurring visual patterns, called dictionary elements, from the data. Because\nit is nonparametric, the number of elements found is also determined from the\ndata. We test the results on both benchmark and natural images, comparing with\nseveral other models from the research literature. We perform large-scale human\nevaluation experiments to assess the visual quality of the results. In a first\nimplementation, we use Gibbs sampling to approximate the posterior. However,\nthis algorithm is not feasible for large-scale data. To circumvent this, we\nthen develop an online variational Bayes (VB) algorithm. This algorithm finds\nhigh quality dictionaries in a fraction of the time needed by the Gibbs\nsampler.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [279309917, 271771570, 273534872, 274738446, 283121542, 283906030], "references": [224381249, 220320877, 224135979, 200038912, 224177314, 221618332, 220321011, 5621705, 220385839, 226435002], "authors": ["Gungor Polatkan", "Mingyuan Zhou", "Lawrence Carin", "David Blei", "Ingrid Daubechies"], "title": "A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach to Image Super-Resolution"}
