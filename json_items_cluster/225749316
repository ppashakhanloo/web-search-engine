{"id": 225749316, "abstract": "We propose and study the use of convex constrained optimization techniques for solving large-scale Generalized Sylvester Equations\n(GSE). For that, we adapt recently developed globalized variants of the projected gradient method to a convex constrained\nleast-squares approach for solving GSE. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different applications. First,\nwe apply it to solve the GSE that appears after applying left and right preconditioning schemes to the linear problems associated\nwith the discretization of some partial differential equations. Second, we apply the new approach, combined with a Tikhonov\nregularization term, to restore some blurred and highly noisy images.\n\nKeywordsConvex optimization–Spectral projected gradient method–Generalized Sylvester equation–Image restoration", "cluster": "3", "citations": [262566067, 220560793, 254808452, 257927301, 261861176, 262566065, 285955280, 275341545, 282189149, 283180995], "references": [224680516, 242560529, 246780955, 225101142, 233801151, 222081274, 225262002, 227209666, 244964002, 2865353], "authors": ["A.
