{"id": 262841099, "abstract": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are frequently used to approximately\nsimulate high-dimensional, multimodal probability distributions. In adaptive\nMCMC methods, the transition kernel is changed \"on the fly\" in the hope to\nspeed up convergence. We study interacting tempering, an adaptive MCMC\nalgorithm based on interacting Markov chains, that can be seen as a simplified\nversion of the equi-energy sampler. Using a coupling argument, we show that\nunder easy to verify assumptions on the target distribution (on a finite\nspace), the interacting tempering process rapidly forgets its starting\ndistribution. The result applies, among others, to exponential random graph\nmodels, the Ising and Potts models (in mean field or on a bounded degree\ngraph), as well as (Edwards-Anderson) Ising spin glasses. As a cautionary note,\nwe also exhibit an example of a target distribution for which the interacting\ntempering process rapidly forgets its starting distribution, but takes an\nexponential number of steps (in the dimension of the state space) to converge\nto its limiting distribution. As a consequence, we argue that convergence\ndiagnostics that are based on demonstrating that the process has forgotten its\nstarting distribution might be of limited use for adaptive MCMC algorithms like\ninteracting tempering.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [51916712, 49458431, 252341360, 230569757, 2950515, 48207611, 2682821, 221700496, 51916417, 38363224], "authors": ["Winfried Barta"], "title": "Forgetting the starting distribution in finite interacting tempering"}
