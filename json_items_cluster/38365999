{"id": 38365999, "abstract": "Let $R$ be the set of real numbers, $\\mathscr{B}_1$ the set of Borel sets of $R$, and $\\mu$ a $\\sigma$-finite nonnegative measure on $\\mathscr{B}_1$. Let $\\Omega$ be an open real number interval (which may be infinite). Throughout we consider a Koopman-Darmois family \\begin{equation*}\\tag{1}\\{h(\\theta) \\exp (\\theta x), \\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega\\}\\end{equation*} of generalized probability density functions on the measure space $(R, \\mathscr{B}_1, \\mu)$. We consider one sided tests $T$ of the hypothesis $\\theta < 0$ against the alternative $\\theta > 0$. In general, in this paper, $T$ will be a sequential procedure. Associated with $T$ is a stopping variable $N$ (mention of the dependence of $N$ on $T$ is usually omitted). $N \\geqq 0. N = n$ means that sampling stopped after $n$ observations and a decision was made. In this context we consider $\\infty$ to be an integer, and $N = \\infty$ means that sampling does not stop. In the discussion of Section 1 we will assume that if $\\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega$ and $\\theta \\neq 0$ then $P_\\theta(N < \\infty) = 1$, that is, sampling stops with probability one. The reason for the exclusion of $\\theta = 0$ will become apparent in Section 1. We will be concerned with two events, decide $\\theta < 0$, and, decide $\\theta > 0$. The main result of this paper may be stated as follows. Theorem 1. Suppose $(R, \\mathscr{B}_1, \\mu), \\Omega$, and $\\{h(\\theta) \\exp (\\theta x), \\theta \\varepsilon \\Omega\\}$ are as described above. Define \\begin{align*}\\mu_\\theta = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} h(\\theta)x \\exp(\\theta x)\\mu(dx), \\\\ \\tag{2} \\\\ \\sigma^2 = \\int^\\infty_{-\\infty} h(0)x^2\\mu(dx),\\end{align*} and assume $\\mu_0 = 0$. Suppose $0 < \\alpha < 1$ and $0 < \\beta < 1$ and \\begin{equation*}\\tag{3}\\sup_{\\theta > 0} P_\\theta (\\text{ decide } \\theta < 0) \\leqq \\beta;\\quad \\sup_{\\theta < 0} P_\\theta (\\text{ decide } \\theta > 0) \\leqq \\alpha.\\end{equation*} Then \\begin{align*}\\lim \\sup_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0+} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N \\geqq 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N &= \\infty); \\\\ \\tag{4} \\lim \\sup_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0-} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N \\geqq 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N &= \\infty).\\end{align*} If $\\alpha + \\beta < 1$ there is a generalized sequential probability ratio test $T$ with stopping variable $N$ such that for the test $T$, \\begin{equation*}\\tag{5}P_0(N = \\infty) = 1 - (\\alpha + \\beta);\\quad (3) \\text{ holds };\\end{equation*} for the test $T$, \\begin{equation*}\\tag{6}\\lim_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\mu^2_\\theta|\\log|\\log\\mid\\mu_\\theta|\\|^{-1}E_\\theta N = 2\\sigma^2 P_0(N = \\infty).\\end{equation*} For all tests $T$, if $P_0(N = \\infty) > 0$ then $\\lim_{\\theta \\rightarrow 0} \\theta^2E_\\theta N = \\infty$. In Section 1, (7) and (8), it is shown that $P_0(N = \\infty) \\geqq 1 - \\alpha - \\beta$. Consequently the relations (4) and (5) of Theorem 1 are not vacuous. We were led to formulate Theorem 1 by a problem of constructing bounded length confidence intervals. The relationship is explained in Section 2. The proof of Theorem 1 is given in Section 3.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [259478458, 237276412, 7187520, 7187532, 38365149, 30765793, 38358010, 38358344, 225921486, 240925027], "references": [], "authors": ["R.
