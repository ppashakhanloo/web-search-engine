{"id": 3158954, "abstract": "This paper addresses new hop-timing (epoch) estimation schemes\nwhich employ a coarsely channelized preprocessor in order to suppress\nthe frequency and phase dependence in random frequency-hopping (FH)\nsignals. Coarse channelization implies a bank of filters, covering the\ntotal spread bandwidth of the FH signal, whose number is much smaller\nthan the size of the candidate hop frequency set. Linear and nonlinear\ncombinations of preprocessor outputs are explored and compared. It is\nfound that post-processing, rather than the size of the filter bank\nalone, is the determining factor on estimation performance. Performance\nevaluation is presented via both extensive computer simulations and\nanalytical lower bounds. Comparisons with existing optimal and\nsuboptimal systems are also provided", "cluster": "4", "citations": [220553471, 3318268, 3717808, 3158948, 251596929, 235112537, 3433312, 221370900, 224641445, 235202353], "references": [3157551, 3005994, 224725277, 3157918, 3235274, 3159340, 3158684, 3232740, 3522592, 44547490], "authors": ["L.
