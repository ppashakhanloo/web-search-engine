{"id": 221110148, "abstract": "We propose a novel graphical model for probabilistic image segmentation that contributes both to aspects of perceptual grouping in connection with image segmentation, and to globally optimal inference with higher-order graphical models. We represent image partitions in terms of cellular complexes in order to make the duality between connected regions and their contours explicit. This allows us to formulate a graphical model with higher-order factors that represent the requirement that all contours must be closed. The model induces a probability measure on the space of all partitions, concentrated on perceptually meaningful segmentations. We give a complete polyhedral characterization of the resulting global inference problem in terms of the multicut polytope and efficiently compute global optima by a cutting plane method. Competitive results for the Berkeley segmentation benchmark confirm the consistency of our approach.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [290978520, 283762266, 284168622, 281608020, 279968378, 275953461, 273101688, 264535188, 264547309, 236946605], "references": [228723293, 221996717, 221361944, 221363985, 220728684, 238179827, 222308107, 221364415, 221618462, 2477494], "authors": ["Björn Andres", "Jörg H.
