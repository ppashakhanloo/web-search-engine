{"id": 258342205, "abstract": "Exploiting label correlations is a challenging and\ncrucial problem especially in multi-label learning context. Labels\ncorrelations are not necessarily shared by all instances and\nhave generally a local definition. This paper introduces LOCLDA,\nwhich is a latent variable model that adresses the problem\nof modeling annotated data by locally exploiting correlations\nbetween annotations. In particular, we represent explicitly local\ndependencies to define the correspondence between specific\nobjects, i.e. regions of images and their annotations. We\nconducted experiments on a collection of pictures provided by\nthe Wikipedia \"Picture of the day\" and evaluated our model on\nthe task of \"automatic image annotation\". The results validate\nthe effectiveness of our approach.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [269524692, 290863442], "references": [221345245, 221363125, 220319974, 50402189, 2491892, 221304789, 221619768, 1761888, 5948829, 45904170], "authors": ["El Mehdi Rochd", "Mohamed Quafafou", "Mustapha Aznag"], "title": "Encoding Local Correspondence in Topic Models"}
