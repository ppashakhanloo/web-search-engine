{"id": 220270203, "abstract": "We define a probability distribution over equivalence classes of binary ma- trices with a finite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns. This distribution is suitable for use as a prior in probabilistic models that represent objects using a potentially infinite array of features. We derive the distribution by taking the limit of a distribution over N Ã— K binary matrices as K ! 1, a strategy inspired by the derivation of the Chinese restaurant process (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002) as the limit of a Dirichlet-multinomial model. This strategy preserves the exchangeability of the rows of matrices. We define several simple generative processes that result in the same distri- bution over equivalence classes of binary matrices, one of which we call the Indian buffet process. We illustrate the use of this distribution as a prior in an infinite latent feature model, deriving a Markov chain Monte Carlo algo- rithm for inference in this model and applying this algorithm to an artificial dataset.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [288889800, 283433373, 283279776, 282603739, 281144567, 280062180, 281076688, 274012431, 268451692, 267570378], "references": [229100346, 229100417, 27290603, 2741222, 2641493, 245581848, 2251788, 221618091, 243662369, 221996674], "authors": ["Tom Griffiths", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "title": "Infinite Latent Feature Models and the Indian Buffet Process"}
