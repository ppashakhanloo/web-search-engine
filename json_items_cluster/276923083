{"id": 276923083, "abstract": "Hidden Markov models can describe time series arising in various fields of\nscience, by treating the data as noisy measurements of an arbitrarily complex\nMarkov process. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have become standard tools\nto estimate the hidden Markov process given the observations and a fixed\nparameter value. We review some of the recent developments allowing the\ninclusion of parameter uncertainty as well as model uncertainty. The\nshortcomings of the currently available methodology are emphasised from an\nalgorithmic complexity perspective. The statistical objects of interest for\ntime series analysis are illustrated on a toy \"Lotka-Volterra\" model used in\npopulation ecology. Some open challenges are discussed regarding the\nscalability of the reviewed methodology to longer time series,\nhigher-dimensional state spaces and more flexible models.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [225464292, 261952439, 231609430, 4217606, 227522317, 259441094, 5218127, 5110883, 230693177, 262805663], "authors": ["Pierre E.
