{"id": 229157569, "abstract": "Bayesian learning in undirected graphical models|computing posterior\ndistributions over parameters and predictive quantities is exceptionally\ndifficult. We conjecture that for general undirected models, there are no\ntractable MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) schemes giving the correct\nequilibrium distribution over parameters. While this intractability, due to the\npartition function, is familiar to those performing parameter optimisation,\nBayesian learning of posterior distributions over undirected model parameters\nhas been unexplored and poses novel challenges. we propose several approximate\nMCMC schemes and test on fully observed binary models (Boltzmann machines) for\na small coronary heart disease data set and larger artificial systems. While\napproximations must perform well on the model, their interaction with the\nsampling scheme is also important. Samplers based on variational mean- field\napproximations generally performed poorly, more advanced methods using loopy\npropagation, brief sampling and stochastic dynamics lead to acceptable\nparameter posteriors. Finally, we demonstrate these techniques on a Markov\nrandom field with hidden variables.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [279968317, 228092029, 228092010, 227716431, 225167936, 224943851, 228633024, 221707689, 229032117, 224093333], "references": [234140148, 1820164, 8195073, 239067001, 2567273, 30967982, 240108003, 239582331, 3192689, 222883365], "authors": ["Iain Murray", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "title": "Bayesian Learning in Undirected Graphical Models: Approximate MCMC\nalgorithms"}
