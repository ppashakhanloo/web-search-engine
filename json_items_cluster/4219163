{"id": 4219163, "abstract": "This paper describes a method to detect smiles and laughter sounds from the video of natural dialogue. A smile is the most common facial expression observed in a dialogue. Detecting a user's smiles and laughter sounds can be useful for estimating the mental state of the user of a spoken-dialogue-based user interface. In addition, detecting laughter sound can be utilized to prevent the speech recognizer from wrongly recognizing the laughter sound as meaningful words. In this paper, a method to detect smile expression and laughter sound robustly by combining an image-based facial expression recognition method and an audio-based laughter sound recognition method. The image-based method uses a feature vector based on feature point detection from face images. The method could detect smile faces by more than 80% recall and precision rate. A method to combine a GMM-based laughter sound recognizer and the image-based method could improve the accuracy of detection of laughter sounds compared with methods that use image or sound only. As a result, more than 70% recall and precision rate of laughter sound detection was obtained from the natural conversation videos.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [261264862, 269108074, 224929669, 51501156, 224246552, 221406305, 221052334, 221040350, 224313060, 221368673], "references": [229880199, 3973879, 220181587, 222657342, 228817545, 221484875, 3765165, 11904369, 3193219, 4219163], "authors": ["A Ito", "Xinyue Wang", "M Suzuki", "S Makino"], "title": "Smile and laughter recognition using speech processing and face recognition from conversation video"}
