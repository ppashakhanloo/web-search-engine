{"id": 288179574, "abstract": "We consider convergence properties of particle filters with Gaussian importance distributions for certain time-varying Poisson regression models. We analyze both the classical bounded-importance-weight condition and a more recent moment condition. We show that Gaussian importance distributions based on Laplace approximations or non-linear Kalman filters lead to particle filters that are not guaranteed to converge. We also suggest avoiding the problem by a certain split-Gaussian modification that naturally arises from ensuring bounded weights. Although in this paper we concentrate on the time-varying Poisson regression model, we argue that our findings have implications in more general particle filtering problems.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [], "references": [38339872, 287422283, 3318241, 4895745, 3319722, 286119652, 267173362, 5097550, 224718050, 200744518], "authors": ["Juho Kokkala", "Simo Särkkä"], "title": "On the (non-)convergence of particle filters with Gaussian importance distributions**This work was supported by the Academy of Finland projects 266940 and 273475."}
