{"id": 267568486, "abstract": "5 SUMMARY We propose a Bayesian method for clustering from discrete data structures that commonly arise in genetics and other applications. This method is equivariant with respect to relabeling units; unsampled units do not interfere with sampled data; and missing data do not hinder infer-ence. Cluster inference using the posterior mode performs well on simulated and real data sets, 10 and the posterior predictive distribution enables supervised learning based on a partial clustering of the sample.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [280311472], "references": [265505693, 230996389, 18499361, 200101672, 17835231, 2348531, 10694705, 227369320, 22439656, 30962620], "authors": ["Harry Crane"], "title": "Miscellanea: Generalized Ewens-Pitman model for Bayesian clustering"}
