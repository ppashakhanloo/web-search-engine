{"id": 224088111, "abstract": "Automatic analysis of social interactions attracts major attention in the computing community, but relatively few benchmarks are available to researchers active in the domain. This paper presents a new, publicly available, corpus of political debates including not only raw data, but a rich set of socially relevant annotations such as turn-taking (who speaks when and how much), agreement and disagreement between participants, and role played by people involved in each debate. The collection includes 70 debates for a total of 43 hours and 10 minutes of material.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [281901270, 261276848, 260564474, 230608464, 49461034, 48340640, 257513015, 254706224, 235779351, 251976441], "references": [45937214, 220147784, 261651815, 228930411, 224586618, 275779047, 220147804, 222430190, 224088111, 224088111], "authors": ["Alessandro Vinciarelli", "Alfred Dielmann", "Sarah Favre", "Hugues Salamin"], "title": "Canal9: A database of political debates for analysis of social interactions"}
