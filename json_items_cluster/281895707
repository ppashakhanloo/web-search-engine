{"id": 281895707, "abstract": "  Tree structures are ubiquitous in data across many domains, and many datasets\nare naturally modelled by unobserved tree structures. In this paper, first we\nreview the theory of random fragmentation processes [Bertoin, 2006], and a\nnumber of existing methods for modelling trees, including the popular nested\nChinese restaurant process (nCRP). Then we define a general class of\nprobability distributions over trees: the Dirichlet fragmentation process (DFP)\nthrough a novel combination of the theory of Dirichlet processes and random\nfragmentation processes. This DFP presents a stick-breaking construction, and\nrelates to the nCRP in the same way the Dirichlet process relates to the\nChinese restaurant process. Furthermore, we develop a novel hierarchical\nmixture model with the DFP, and empirically compare the new model to similar\nmodels in machine learning. Experiments show the DFP mixture model to be\nconvincingly better than existing state-of-the-art approaches for hierarchical\nclustering and density modelling.
