{"id": 261235391, "abstract": "We adopt a two-layer regression model for music pleasure regression. Pleasure orientation of a song is estimated first, and then different regressors are used to predict degree of pleasure according to the estimated orientation. By using corresponding regressors for each instance, there is a big improvement when we assume the first layer is perfect in comparison with one-layer model. By tuning the confidence threshold of the orientation classifier of the two-layer model, we get improvement over one-layer model.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [272521878], "references": [224166070, 228695729, 3458005, 239604183, 221900777, 224576802, 220723083, 220723554, 26621599, 220499847], "authors": ["Xing Wang", "Yuqian Wu", "Xiaoou Chen", "Deshun Yang"], "title": "A two-layer model for music pleasure regression"}
