{"id": 283235980, "abstract": "The Targeted Random Sampling (TRS) method is extended to moderate-to-high dimensional time invariant reliability analysis. TRS is an adaptive sampling method rooted in stratified sampling variance reduction technique and represents a specific algorithm for Refined Stratified Sampling. In this work, a Markov Chain is used to sample the space densely in the vicinity of the limit stat and multi-dimensional stratum division is proposed along with a neural network based approximation of the performance function. The method is shown to perform efficiently and accurately for estimation of probability of failure for a 20 dimensional problem.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [222546544, 244955839, 223307920, 223858805, 236660847, 223168999, 236660920, 210222819, 222672830, 276211091], "authors": ["Michael D Shields", "V S Sundar"], "title": "Targeted Random Sampling for Time-invariant Reliability Analysis"}
