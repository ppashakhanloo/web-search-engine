{"id": 262560295, "abstract": "Human beings not only possess the remarkable ability to distinguish objects through tactile feedback but are further able to improve upon recognition competence through experience. In this work, we explore tactile-based object recognition with learners capable of incremental learning. Using the sparse online infinite Echo-State Gaussian process (OIESGP), we propose and compare two novel discriminative and generative tactile learners that produce probability distributions over objects during object grasping/palpation. To enable iterative improvement, our online methods incorporate training samples as they become available. We also describe incremental unsupervised learning mechanisms, based on novelty scores and extreme value theory, when teacher labels are not available. We present experimental results for both supervised and unsupervised learning tasks using the iCub humanoid, with tactile sensors on its five-fingered anthropomorphic hand, and 10 different object classes. Our classifiers perform comparably to state-of-the-art methods (C4.5 and SVM classifiers) and findings indicate that tactile signals are highly relevant for making accurate object classifications. We also show that accurate “early” classifications are possible using only 20-30% of the grasp sequence. For unsupervised learning, our methods generate high quality clusterings relative to the widely-used sequential k-means and selforganising map (SOM), and we present analyses into the differences between the approaches.", "cluster": "3", "citations": [291344724, 280716564, 283122708], "references": [224156379, 224236600, 228667424, 230838286, 224568004, 221065646, 224252758, 11500673, 2433873, 51580418], "authors": ["Harold Soh", "Yiannis Demiris"], "title": "Incrementally Learning Objects by Touch: Online Discriminative and Generative Models for Tactile-Based Recognition"}
