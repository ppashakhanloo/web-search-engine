{"id": 45860846, "abstract": "The paper proposes a Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to\nresolve the shortcomings of existing Monte Carlo algorithms when sampling from\ntarget densities that may be high dimensional and exhibit strong correlations.\nThe method provides a fully automated adaptation mechanism that circumvents the\ncostly pilot runs required to tune proposal densities for Metropolis-Hastings\nor indeed Hybrid Monte Carlo and Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithms. This\nallows for highly efficient sampling even in very high dimensions where\ndifferent scalings may be required for the transient and stationary phases of\nthe Markov chain. The proposed method exploits the Riemannian structure of the\nparameter space of statistical models and thus automatically adapts to the\nlocal manifold structure at each step based on the metric tensor. A\nsemi-explicit second order symplectic integrator for non-separable Hamiltonians\nis derived for simulating paths across this manifold which provides highly\nefficient convergence and exploration of the target density. The performance of\nthe Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is assessed by\nperforming posterior inference on logistic regression models, log-Gaussian Cox\npoint processes, stochastic volatility models, and Bayesian estimation of\nparameter posteriors of dynamical systems described by nonlinear differential\nequations. Substantial improvements in the time normalised Effective Sample\nSize are reported when compared to alternative sampling approaches.
