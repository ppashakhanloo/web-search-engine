{"id": 280970148, "abstract": "The scan statistic is by far the most popular method for anomaly detection,\nbeing popular in syndromic surveillance, signal and image processing, and\ntarget detection based on sensor networks, among other applications. The use of\nthe scan statistics in such settings yields an hypotheses testing procedure,\nwhere the null hypothesis corresponds to the absence of anomalous behavior. If\nthe null distribution is known, then calibration of a scan-based test is\nrelatively easy, as it can be done by Monte-Carlo simulation. When the null\ndistribution is unknown, it is not clear what the best way to proceed is. We\npropose two procedures. One is a calibration by permutation and the other is a\nrank-based scan test, which is distribution-free and less sensitive to\noutliers. Furthermore, the rank-scan test requires only a one-time calibration\nfor a given data size making it computationally more appealing. In both cases,\nwe quantify the performance loss with respect to an oracle scan test that knows\nthe null distribution, and show one incurs only a very small loss in the\ncontext of a natural exponential family. These results include the classical\nnormal location model, as well as Poisson model popular in syndromic\nsurveillance. We perform numerical experiments on simulated data further\nsupporting our theory, and also experiments with a real dataset from genomics.", "cluster": "2", "citations": [], "references": [45868789, 45896077, 2135064, 3085488, 50948508, 265357796, 256606492, 267128815, 38350975, 235423341], "authors": ["Ery Arias-Castro", "Rui M.
