{"id": 2251788, "abstract": "this paper to exhibit a general framework for hierarchical linear modelling and density estimation, to show how posterior computations via Markov chain simulations can be routinely applied, and to provide illustrations in each context. Section 2 provides a rather general theoretical setting and summarises key features of multivariate data models with hierarchical mixture priors. Section 3 discusses Markov chain simulation methods in these models, with special emphasis on models centred around traditional normal structures. Section 4 concerns an application in hierarchical regression, highlighting the use of mixture priors for robustness and sensitivity analysis, and Section 5 develops an application to multivariate density estimation. y", "cluster": "4", "citations": [279977982, 51950172, 258255076, 220286570, 229438642, 222540996, 224124510, 220586386, 45907375, 251651135], "references": [2741222, 243689785, 265782246, 241721720, 257701639, 38357862], "authors": ["Mike West", "Peter M", "Michael D Escobar"], "title": "Hierarchical Priors and Mixture Models, With Application in Regression and Density Estimation"}
