{"id": 246427191, "abstract": "We use simulation studies (a) to compare Bayesian and likelihood fitting methods, in terms of validity of conclusions, in two-level random-slopes regression (RSR) models, and (b) to compare several Bayesian estimation methods based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, in terms of computational efficiency, in random-effects logistic regression (RELR) models. We find (a) that the Bayesian approach with a particular choice of diffuse inverse Wishart prior distribution for the (co)variance parameters performs at least as well-in terms of bias of estimates and actual coverage of nominal 95% intervals-as maximum likelihood methods in RSR models with medium sample sizes (expressed in terms of the number J of level-2 units), but neither approach performs as well as might be hoped wit small J; and (b) that an adaptive hybrid Metropolis-Gibbs sampling method we have developed for use in the multilevel modeling package MlwiN outperforms adaptive rejection Gibbs sampling in the RELR models we have considered, sometimes by a wide margin.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [280266537, 225821870, 49853922, 229694970, 242997805, 26874655, 235726163, 27706315, 4898680, 2501030], "references": [2501030, 265423254, 224910613, 38363224, 246048559], "authors": ["William J.
