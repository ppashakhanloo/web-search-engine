{"id": 221259802, "abstract": "Statistical models of the shape and appearance of image structures can be matched to new images using both the Active Shape Model [7] algorithm and the Active Appearance Model algorithm [2]. The former searches along profiles about the current model point positions to update the current estimate of the shape of the object. The latter samples the image data under the current instance and uses the difference between model and sample to update the appearance model parameters. In this paper we compare and contrast the two algorithms, giving the results of experiments testing their performance on two data sets, one of faces, the other of structures in MR brain sections. We find that the ASM is faster and achieves more accurate feature point location than the AAM, but the AAM gives a better match to the texture.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [279968557, 264295959, 259988245, 259268594, 262744445, 236085067, 280321395, 225301473, 273979463, 220502492], "references": [222314551, 221196947, 4194011, 256520073, 13414377, 15265541, 220610581, 257485030, 243762748, 3192708], "authors": ["Timothy F.
