{"id": 275669988, "abstract": "This paper explores the preference-based top-$K$ rank aggregation problem.\nSuppose that a collection of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one\nwishes to recover a consistent ordering that emphasizes the top-$K$ ranked\nitems, based on partially revealed preferences. We focus on the\nBradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set of latent preference\nscores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only\non the relative scores of the items involved.\nWe characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-$K$ ranked\nitems, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results\nhighlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores\nbetween the $K^{\\text{th}}$ and $(K+1)^{\\text{th}}$ ranked items. The minimum\nsample complexity required for reliable top-$K$ ranking scales inversely with\nthe separation measure irrespective of other preference distribution metrics.\nTo approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme,\ncalled \\emph{Spectral MLE}, that returns the indices of the top-$K$ items in\naccordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with\nan initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral\nmethod), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of\ncoordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-$K$ item\nidentification under minimal sample complexity. The practical applicability of\nSpectral MLE is further corroborated by numerical experiments.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [288890243], "references": [264933916, 47637732, 254017290, 254006797, 267695838, 264674014, 221140866, 265665852, 1897633, 224959372], "authors": ["Yuxin Chen", "Changho Suh"], "title": "Spectral MLE: Top-$K$ Rank Aggregation from Pairwise Comparisons"}
