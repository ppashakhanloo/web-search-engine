{"id": 222469073, "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel statistical latent class model for probabilistic grouping of distributional and histogram data. Adopting the Bayesian framework, we propose to perform annealed maximum a posteriori estimation to compute optimal clustering solutions. In order to accelerate the optimization process, an efficient multiscale formulation is developed. We present a prototypical application of this method for unsupervised segmentation of textured images based on local distributions of Gabor coefficients. Benchmark results indicate superior performance compared to K-means clustering and proximity-based algorithms. In a second application the histogram clustering method is utilized to structure image databases for improved image retrieval.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [252761734, 220659990, 221363672, 222835755, 220660220, 3193528, 220181521, 5613825, 220502327, 220797552], "references": [3766396, 220600789, 3192873, 2473382, 223616307, 2477494, 2954453, 224271512, 222495910, 223673272], "authors": ["Jan Puzicha", "Thomas Hofmann", "Joachim M.
