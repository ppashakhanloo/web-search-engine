{"id": 271387816, "abstract": "We introduce an adaptive output-sensitive inference algorithm for MCMC and\nprobabilistic programming, Adaptive Random Database. The algorithm is based on\na single-site updating Metropolis-Hasting sampler, the Random Database (RDB)\nalgorithm. Adaptive RDB (ARDB) differs from the original RDB in that the\nschedule of selecting variables proposed for modification is adapted based on\nthe output of of the probabilistic program, rather than being fixed and\nuniform. We show that ARDB still converges to the correct distribution. We\ncompare ARDB to RDB on several test problems highlighting different aspects of\nthe adaptation scheme.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [], "references": [227276601, 49458431, 252341360, 239595911, 267079262, 221405260, 266657500, 261289213, 263856183, 228789130], "authors": ["David Tolpin", "Jan Willem van de Meent", "Brooks Paige", "Frank Wood"], "title": "Adaptive Scheduling in MCMC and Probabilistic Programming"}
