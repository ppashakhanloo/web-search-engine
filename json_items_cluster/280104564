{"id": 280104564, "abstract": "Inverse problems consist in inferring parameters of model distributions that\nare able to fit properly chosen features of experimental data-sets. The Inverse\nIsing problem specifically consists of searching for the maximal entropy\ndistribution reproducing frequencies and correlations of a binary data-set. In\norder to solve this task, we propose an algorithm that takes advantage of the\nprovided by the data knowledge of the log-likelihood function around the\nsolution. We show that the present algorithm is faster than standard gradient\nascent methods. Moreover, by looking at the algorithm convergence as a\nstochastic process, we properly define over-fitting and we show how the present\nalgorithm avoids it by construction.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [], "references": [221345128, 7155656, 26254570, 23713474, 256291566, 250917493, 263097302, 2996540, 26728365, 258851649], "authors": ["Ulisse Ferrari"], "title": "Approximated Newton Algorithm for the Ising Model Inference Speeds Up Convergence, Performs Optimally and Avoids Over-fitting"}
