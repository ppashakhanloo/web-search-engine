{"id": 279633530, "abstract": "  Drawing a sample from a discrete distribution is one of the building\ncomponents for Monte Carlo methods. Like other sampling algorithms, discrete\nsampling also suffers from high computational burden in large-scale inference\nproblems. We study the problem of sampling a discrete random variable with a\nhigh degree of dependency that is typical in large-scale Bayesian inference and\ngraphical models, and propose an efficient approximate solution with a\nsubsampling approach. We make a novel connection between the discrete sampling\nand Multi-Armed Bandits problems with a finite reward population and provide\nthree algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Empirical evaluations show the\nrobustness and efficiency of the approximate algorithms in both synthetic and\nreal-world large-scale problems.
