{"id": 276296321, "abstract": "Clustering is widely studied in statistics and machine learning, with\napplications in a variety of fields. As opposed to classical algorithms which\nreturn a single clustering solution, Bayesian nonparametric models provide a\nposterior over the entire space of partitions, allowing one to assess\nstatistical properties, such as uncertainty on the number of clusters. However,\nan important problem is how to summarize the posterior; the huge dimension of\npartition space and difficulties in visualizing it add to this problem. In a\nBayesian analysis, the posterior of a real-valued parameter of interest is\noften summarized by reporting a point estimate such as the posterior mean along\nwith 95% credible intervals to characterize uncertainty. In this paper, we\nextend these ideas to develop appropriate point estimates and credible sets to\nsummarize the posterior of clustering structure based on decision and\ninformation theoretic techniques.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [279848500], "references": [222420950, 46451644, 4993277, 38357634], "authors": ["Sara Wade", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "title": "Bayesian cluster analysis: Point estimation and credible balls"}
