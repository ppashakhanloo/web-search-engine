{"id": 43279849, "abstract": "This article investigates multivariate spatial process models suitable for predicting multiple forest attributes using a multisource\nforest inventory approach. Such data settings involve several spatially dependent response variables arising in each location.\nNot only does each variable vary across space, they are likely to be correlated among themselves. Traditional approaches have\nattempted to model such data using simplifying assumptions, such as a common rate of decay in the spatial correlation or simplified\ncross-covariance structures among the response variables. Our current focus is to produce spatially explicit, tree species \nspecific, prediction of forest biomass per hectare over a region of interest. Modeling such associations presents challenges\nin terms of validity of probability distributions as well as issues concerning identifiability and estimability of parameters.\nOur template encompasses several models with different correlation structures. These models represent different hypotheses\nwhose tenability are assessed using formal model comparisons. We adopt a Bayesian hierarchical approach offering a sampling-based\ninferential framework using efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for estimating model parameters.", "cluster": "0", "citations": [282610698, 281452652, 42639891, 23226149, 216457235, 40694044, 268054188, 227369257, 227369350, 251626216], "references": [224840090, 240110111, 6810721, 3410822, 248480922, 2492669, 222403820, 237614492, 24065116, 222995982], "authors": ["Andrew O.
