{"id": 266261674, "abstract": "Probabilistic Latent Tensor Factorization (PLTF) is a recently proposed\nprobabilistic framework for modelling multi-way data. Not only the common\ntensor factorization models but also any arbitrary tensor factorization\nstructure can be realized by the PLTF framework. This paper presents full\nBayesian inference via variational Bayes that facilitates more powerful\nmodelling and allows more sophisticated inference on the PLTF framework.
