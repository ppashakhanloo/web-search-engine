{"id": 265375218, "abstract": "The Markov point processes introduced by B. D. Ripley and F. P. Kelly [J. Lond. Math. Soc., II. Ser. 15, 188-192 (1977; Zbl 0354.60037)] are generalized by replacing fixed-range spatial interactions by interactions between neighbouring particles, where the neighbourhood relation may depend on the point configuration. The corresponding Hammersley-Clifford characterization theorem is proved. The results are used to construct new models for point processes, multitype point processes and random processes of geometrical objects. Monte Carlo simulations of these models can be generated by running spatial birth- and-death processes.", "cluster": "4", "citations": [227425535, 227734122, 227413739, 225423989, 227369133, 228365876, 5964859, 225959139, 225773986, 222083362], "references": [247528469, 265706044, 38327814, 246417453, 240296469, 243072549, 229769359, 232128993, 246994359], "authors": ["Adrian Baddeley", "Jesper MÃ¸ller"], "title": "Nearest-Neighbour Markov Point Processes and Random Sets"}
