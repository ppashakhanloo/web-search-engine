{"id": 221345210, "abstract": "The innite hidden Markov model is a non- parametric extension of the widely used hid- den Markov model. Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm for the innite Hidden Markov model called beam sam- pling. Beam sampling combines slice sam- pling, which limits the number of states con- sidered at each time step to a nite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories eciently. Our algo- rithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sam- pler and is more robust. We present appli- cations of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on changepoint detection and text prediction problems.", "cluster": "5", "citations": [263582646, 269164447, 260428846, 259142582, 256589304, 221667869, 229088276, 221016740, 220504941, 224175402], "references": [220270203, 229100346, 229100417, 45860527, 27290603, 265369049, 230600718, 2741222, 46451640, 221996674], "authors": ["Jurgen Van Gael", "Yunus Saatci", "Yee Whye Teh", "Zoubin Ghahramani"], "title": "Beam sampling for the infinite hidden Markov model"}
