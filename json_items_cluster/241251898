{"id": 241251898, "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of choosing a single clustering estimate ^c based on an MCMC sample of clusterings c(1);c(2) :::;c(M) from the posterior distribution of a Bayesian cluster model. Methods to derive ^c based on the posterior similarity matrix, a matrix with entries P(ci = cjjy), the posterior probabilities that the observations i and j are in the same cluster, are reviewed and discussed. Minimization of a com- monly used loss function for this purpose by Binder (1978) is shown to be equivalent to maximizing the Rand index between estimated and true clustering. We propose a new criterion for choosing an estimated cluster- ing, the posterior expected adjusted Rand index with the true clustering, which outperforms Binder's loss, MAP and an ad hoc criterion in a sim- ulation study. An application to Fisher's Iris data is also provided.
